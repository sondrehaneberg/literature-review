Zhang et al. (2025) investigate financial forecasting from Monetary Policy Conference (MPC) calls by integrating textual, visual, and audio modalities through a multimodal, knowledge-enhanced framework named MANAGER. The model combines external financial knowledge (FinDKG), modality-specific encoders (BEiT-3 for video, HuBERT for audio, and text embeddings), and a knowledge-enhanced graph network with ChatGLM2 serving as the large language model backbone. This architecture enables the model to jointly capture semantic, tonal, and visual cues from MPC meetings while leveraging financial context.
Compared to traditional deep learning baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and multimodal transformers without LLM integration, MANAGER achieves significantly improved performance in both price movement and volatility prediction tasks. Specifically, the model attains the highest F1-scores for directional prediction (≈0.67–0.70) and the lowest Mean Squared Error (≈0.033–0.035) for volatility estimation, outperforming all ablated versions. These results highlight that incorporating an LLM (ChatGLM2) with external knowledge and multimodal reasoning substantially enhances predictive accuracy and interpretability, as the model can also generate coherent textual explanations for its forecasts.",Olav,,❌,Modal-adaptive Knowledge-enhanced Graph-based Financial Prediction from Monetary Policy Conference Calls with LLM

approaches to embed this information into the time series model. Among these, Scenario 2, which utilizes a
sequence of historical sentiment scores, consistently delivers the most accurate results across several evaluation
metrics, including MAE and RMSE. This outcome suggests that temporal patterns in sentiment provide valuable
predictive information, underscoring the significance of capturing sentiment dynamics rather than relying solely
on single-day values. However, the effect of sentiment integration is not uniform across all forecasting tasks. In
particular, for relative return predictions, the inclusion of sentiment features occasionally reduced performance,

symbolic methods, which are interpretable, and neural approaches, which are efficient but often opaque. FAMA
integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Cross-Sample Selection (CSS), ensures that the model
is exposed to a wide set of diverse factor examples, helping it avoid producing similar or repetitive outputs.
The second, Chain-of-Experience (CoE), allows the system to build on previously effective patterns, effectively
“learning from experience” to improve the search for high-quality factors. When tested on real S&P 500 stock
market data, FAMA outperformed earlier models. The method improved RankIC by 0.006 and RankICIR by

De bruker ikke en LLM direkte, men heller ideen bak.

Dette kalles in-context learning – modellen lærer på stedet ut fra konteksteksempler uten å trene på nytt.
Song et al. overfører denne idéen til finans:
• De lager “demonstrasjoner” av markedet — oppsummeringer av hva som nylig har gått opp eller ned.
• Disse demonstrasjonene blir som prompten i en LLM.
• Deretter lager de en egen nettverksarkitektur som endrer vektene sine dynamisk ut fra denne konteksten.
Dermed imiterer de LLM-ens evne til å lære fra kontekst, men med et spesialbygd nettverk for aksjedata.

To alleviate this issue, the recently popularized concept of In-Context learning has provided
us with valuable insights. In this approach, large language models
(LLMs) are exposed to multiple examples of input-label pairs, also
known as demonstrations, as part of the prompt before performing a task on an unseen example. By thoroughly analyzing these
demonstrations, LLMs can uncover potential patterns and effectively adapt to new tasks. Building upon this concept, we propose a
Context-Informed drift-aware method for Stock Prediction (CISP),
which continually adjusts to the latest market styles and offers
more accurate predictions. ",Olav,,❌,Follow the Will of the Market: A Context-Informed Drift-Aware Method for Stock Prediction

News data are aligned with the subsequent trading hour on the NYSE. Summaries of news articles are generated using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and analyzed with VADER, FinBERT, and GPT-3.5 Turbo, where GPT is applied in a zero-shot setting. The results show that FinBERT achieves higher SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values than GPT-3.5, likely due to its domain-specific training on financial texts.

The authors verified the robustness of this approach by testing multiple prompt formulations, finding that ChatGPT produced stable and consistent sentiment values, which supports the validity of the results. Machine learning models---specifically regression models for predicting the magnitude of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) and classification models for forecasting their direction---were then trained using these sentiment scores. The findings indicate that ChatGPT-derived sentiment significantly improves the models' ability to describe and predict intraday stock movements compared to baseline specifications.",Olav,,❌,Intraday Stock Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis: Evidence from Dividend Announcements
