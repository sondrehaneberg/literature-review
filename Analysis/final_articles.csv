In this paper, we compare three sequential deep learning models - LSTM, Transformer, and Large Language Models (LLMs) - for stock price prediction. By transforming the regression problem of predicting daily log returns into a classification task, we evaluate the models' classification accuracies, with the Transformer achieving the highest accuracy of 22%, followed by LSTM (15.6%) and LLM (15.3%). Regression metrics showed LSTM initially performing better, with a lower RMSE (180.92) than LLM (1739.61). However, outlier predictions in the LLM, caused by incomplete number outputs, inflated its error. After removing these outliers, LLM's RMSE improved significantly to 33.85, surpassing LSTM. These results demonstrate the potential of Transformer and LLM models for financial time series prediction. Future work will explore incorporating self-reflection mechanisms in LLM predictions and extending the comparison to multivariate financial time series incorporating textual data and other features. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Piscataway, English,,Time Series Forecasting;Survey;Large Language Model;Deep Learning;Finance,28 Jan 2025,,,," Accuracy , Comparative studies , Outliers (statistics) , FINANCE , Deep learning , Classification , Large language models , Soft computing , Root-mean-square errors , SUSTAINABILITY , Multivariate analysis , Machine learning , Deep learning , SUSTAINABILITY , Predictions , Large language models , Time series , SUSTAINABILITY , Economic","11th International Conference on Soft Computing and Machine Intelligence, ISCMI 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001566756&doi=10.1109%2FISCMI63661.2024.10851487&partnerID=40&md5=01b3354bb386d4b067780ca4842621ba,,28 Jan 2025,,,,,,,Melbourne; VIC,,," Independent Researcher , University of North Texas , Meta , Taylor University , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , I-66 Express Mobility Partners",,Conference Papers & Proceedings,IEEE,,, English,Conference paper,,,,26400154; 26400146,1.0,, 2025-01-28,,,,59718213100; 58506245500; 59718431000; 57554420800; 58951485600; 58951156300,,Deep Learning; Finance; Large Language Model; Survey; Time Series Forecasting,979-8-3315-1812-7,,,,,22.0,,,IEEE Conferences,26,,,,,,,,, 2024,,,32.0,2024,

Traditional machine learning methods are limited by their structures and parameter size, which hinders their generalizability and effectiveness. Large language models (LLMs), which are pretrained with very large dataset and many GPUs have recently shown promising improvements in financial risk prediction. Despite this progress, most existing financial LLMs mainly rely on textual data for training and prediction, overlooking audio data and limiting analysis to text summarization. However, natural language processing studies have shown that audio from CEOs' quarterly earnings calls is crucial for financial risk prediction. In this work, we introduce an audio-text LLM named ATFinGPT, which fuses financial audio data and summarization texts for financial risk prediction. The empirical experimental results show that AT-FinGPT is superior to most advanced methods. Through an ablation study, we demonstrate that different data sources can facilitate financial risk assessment and discuss the effectiveness of each part in the AT-FinGPT model.",,,,,zhaozhenyu@nbu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,MAR 2025,,,,,,,,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",,,,,,9.0,,,FINANC RES LETT,,Z9D9B,,,,MAY,Quantitative finance; Large language model; FinGPT; Multi-sources data fusion,,,"Aniunas P., 2009, Eng.

This paper presents the first empirical evaluation of Lag-Llama, a novel probabilistic time series forecasting model, for predicting stock prices on the Indonesian Stock Exchange (IDX). By applying Lag-Llama to both univariate and multi-time series forecasts of key IDX stocks, we assess its ability to capture temporal patterns and market volatility, particularly in comparison to state-of-the-art models like DeepAR (RNN) and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our results show that in fine-tuning scenarios Lag-Llama achieves a Continuous Ranked Proba-bility Score (CRPS) of 0.0195 on a combined dataset of three major stocks (BBCA, BMRI, and AMRT), closely matching TFT (CRPS 0.0179) and outperforming DeepAR (CRPS 0.0270). However, forecasting across broader stock groups (Top 1–9 and Top 10–18 by market cap-italization) proves more challenging, with CRPS values rising (e.g. 0.0517 for the Top 1– 9 stocks). This study demonstrates Lag-Llama’s potential as a robust tool for stock price prediction—particularly for select, closely-related stock groupings—offering improved precision and reliability compared to traditional methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010653158&doi=10.54364%2FAAIML.2025.52216&partnerID=40&md5=af449bf9fe333633568f308b94c5be39,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,25829793,,,,,,,6701746699; 58027964800; 57197713884; 57190012615; 56263648000; 55932829400,,Lag-Llama; Large Language Models; Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting; Stock Market Analysis,,,,,,,,,,3833,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

However, backtesting such strategies poses a challenge because LLMs are trained on many years of data, and backtesting produces biased results if the training and backtesting periods overlap. This bias can take two forms: a look-ahead bias, in which the LLM may have specific knowledge of the stock returns that followed a news article, and a distraction effect, in which general knowledge of the companies named interferes with the measurement of a text’s sentiment. The authors investigate these sources of bias through trading strategies driven by the sentiment of financial news headlines. They compare trading performance based on the original headlines with debiased strategies in which they remove the relevant company’s identifiers from the text. In-sample (within the LLM training window), the authors find, surprisingly, that the anonymized headlines outperform, indicating that the distraction effect has a greater impact than look-ahead bias. This tendency is particularly strong for larger companies—companies about which the authors expect an LLM to have greater general knowledge. Out-of-sample, look-ahead bias is not a concern but distraction remains possible. The authors’ proposed anonymization procedure is therefore potentially useful in out-of-sample implementation, as well as for debiased backtesting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184706164&doi=10.3905%2Fjfds.2023.1.143&partnerID=40&md5=7e1bdd6a32d7cbbf0807d00e5a48c6cb,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,26403943; 26403951,,,,,,,7005249626; 58664394000,,,,,,,,,,,,42,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Conventional approaches struggle to comprehend the subtle context, such as sarcasm and new Internet slang, and fail to fuse various sentiments from social media interactions effectively. This paper proposes a framework 11Source code is available at https://gitee.com/Monickar/Fin-Sentiment-LLM. that addresses these issues by fusing context-aware designs and integrating various sentiment signals. Our approach grasps the layered context of conversations and integrates various measurements and their interrelations into one sentiment indicator.

It has gained significant attention due to its potential applications in various domains, including finance, marketing, and public opinion monitoring. In the financial sector, sentiment analysis is essential for analyzing market trends, forecasting stock prices, and guiding investment choices. This research paper compares the performance of lexicon-based method, machine learning technique, and ChatGPT in sentiment analysis of big cap and small cap companies in United States indexes using Twitter data. The purpose of implementing ChatGPT is to identify the usefulness of this well-known tool that is currently flooding the social media scene. The results show that Random Forest achieved the highest accuracy overall with 83.6% on big cap and 78.8% on small cap. ChatGPT sentiment has an accuracy of 77.44% on big cap and 72.43% on small cap. Meanwhile the lowest performing method is the TextBlob which has an accuracy of 46.52% on big cap and 43.57% on small cap. Random Forest is able to understand the context of tweets and handle slang terms and phrases, while ChatGPT is still under development but has the potential to perform better in the future. There are many slang terms and phrases that are used in the stock market that are not included in the TextBlob dictionary. Therefore, the performance of TextBlob is the least performing method. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85204009784&partnerID=40&md5=1fe332f6ed6c322e76d8cfba66572f77,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Article,,,,19928645; 18173195,,,,,,,59327917900; 35103408900,,Chatgpt; Lexicon; Machine Learning; Random Forest; Sentiment Analysis; Textblob,,,,,,,,,,6287,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Traditional option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes equation, depend on simplifying assumptions and struggle to effectively capture complex market dynamics. The study investigates the viability of using the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model to assess the value of stock options. We fine-tune the state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-turbo model by utilizing past option chain data and evaluate its precision in predicting option prices for well-known technology stocks including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT). Our model employs many features, including strike price, underlying price, days to expiry, and volatility index (VIX), to precisely predict option prices. Extensive examination undertaken at various degrees of moneyness and time horizons demonstrates that GPT models consistently surpass Black-Scholes in terms of both mean absolute error and root mean squared error. Out of all the models that were assessed, the 5-year data models exhibit the greatest overall accuracy. An error study suggests that pricing for options at the money has improved, but there are issues in appropriately pricing options that are highly in the money or out of the money.

We assume that financial reports (such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements), historical price data, and recent news articles can collectively represent aforementioned factors.We combine financial data in tabular format with textual news articles and employ pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict market movements. Recent research in LLMs has demonstrated that they are able to perform both tabular and text classification tasks, making them our primary model to classify the multi-modal data. We utilize retrieval augmentation techniques to retrieve and attach relevant chunks of news articles to financial metrics related to a company and prompt the LLMs in zero, two, and four-shot settings. Our dataset contains news articles collected from different sources, historic stock price, and financial report data for 20 companies with the highest trading volume across different industries in the stock market. We utilized recently released language models for our LLM-based classifier, including GPT- 3 and 4, and LLaMA- 2 and 3 models.We introduce an LLM-based classifier capable of performing classification tasks using combination of tabular (structured) and textual (unstructured) data. By using this model, we predicted the movement of a given stock's price in our dataset with a weighted F1-score of 58.5% and 59.1% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.175 for both 3-month and 6-month periods.The dataset and codes for this paper can be found on Github. https://github.com/aliielahi/FinedFMP 1 © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Ankura; IEEE Computer Society; IEEE Dataport; U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF); Virginia Tech,"Ding, W.; Lu, C.-T.; Wang, F.; Di, L.; Wu, K.; Huan, J.; Nambiar, R.; Li, J.; Ilievski, F.; Baeza-Yates, R.; Hu, X.", Piscataway, English,,Financial Stock Price Movement Prediction;Large Language Models;Information Retrieval;Retrieval Augmented Generation,16 Jan 2025,,,," Datasets , Tables (data) , SUSTAINABILITY , Classification , Large language models , Big Data , SUSTAINABILITY , News , ACCTAX , Unstructured data , Modal data , Large language models , Human factors , Correlation coefficients , Correlation coefficient , Economic","2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data, BigData 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218029065&doi=10.1109%2FBigData62323.2024.10825449&partnerID=40&md5=790912932a746f9111e10d052957e832,,16 Jan 2025,,,,,,,Washington; DC,,," University of Illinois Chicago,Department of Computer Science , University of Illinois Chicago,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering",,Conference Papers & Proceedings,IEEE,,, English,Conference paper,,,,2573-2978,2.0,, 2025-01-16,,,,57202994446; 59462463000,,Financial Stock Price Movement Prediction; Information Retrieval; Large Language Models; Retrieval Augmented Generation,979-8-3503-6248-0,,,,,4875.0,,,IEEE Conferences,4883,,,,,,,,, 2024,,,25.0,2024,

The study emphasizes the potential of SLMs as a more accessible and resource-efficient alternative to LLMs, enabling local and in-house deployment. Critical gaps are addressed, including the lack of direct price movement predictions, the utilization and comparison of State-of-the-Art (SotA) models, and the integration of diverse data sources. The research employed a fundamental trading strategy based on predicted stock price movement as the sole trading signal. The Phi-2 model, fine-tuned with Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation (QLoRA) on consumer-grade hardware, was compared with GPT-4, serving as a SotA benchmark. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The results indicate that the fine-tuned SML (Phi-2) outperformed the LLM (GPT-4), albeit by a small margin, demonstrating the potential of a trained SML over a general LLM. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"Maglogiannis, I.; Iliadis, L.; Papaleonidas, A.; Andreou, A.",,,k.j.vdrleij@tilburguniversity.edu; g.manias@tilburguniversity.edu; y.k.leung@tilburguniversity.edu; w.j.a.m.vdnheuvel@tilburguniversity.edu,,,,,,,"21st IFIP WG 12.5 International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations, AIAI 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105010217438&doi=10.1007%2F978-3-031-96235-6_21&partnerID=40&md5=04d8359c28ffc3f6cdaff86b8e6161ba,,,,978-3-031-96237-0; 978-3-031-96235-6; 978-3-031-96234-9,,21st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Applications and Innovations-AIAI-Annual,"JUN 26-29, 2025",,Limassol,,,,"Maglogiannis, I; Iliadis, L; Andreou, A; Papaleonidas, A",,,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,Conference paper,,,15.0,1868422X; 18684238,,IFIP ADV INF COMM TE,,BZ2OR,,,59985058400; 57217107959; 59841401200; 7005472245,,Algorithmic Trading; Artificial Intelligence; Large Language Models; Small Language Models; Stock Price Prediction,,,"[Anonymous], 2011, News, Twitter and Search Engine Data; [Anonymous], 2024, Generative AI in finance market size, share and forecast 2024; Artificial intelligence (AI), 2024, financestatistics & facts; Awan MJ, 2021, CMC-COMPUT MATER CON, V67, P2569, DOI 10.32604/cmc.2021.014253; Brown TJ., 2020, [No title captured], DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2005.14165; CellStrat, 2023, Real-world use cases for large language models (llms); Chae Y, 2023, Large language models for text classification: From zero-shot learning to fine-tuning; Chung J.W., 2023, ML.ENERGY Leaderboard; de Sousa MG, 2019, PROC INT C TOOLS ART, P1597, DOI 10.1109/ICTAI.2019.00231; Fatouros G, 2024, SSRN Electronic Journal, DOI [10.2139/ssrn.4693849, 10.2139/ssrn.4693849, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.4693849]; Gunasekar S, 2023, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2306.11644, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2306.11644]; Ilyas Moutawwakil R.P., 2023, LLM-Perf Leaderboard; Javaheripi M., 2023, Phi-2: The surprising power of small language models; Kocon J, 2023, INFORM FUSION, V99, DOI 10.1016/j.inffus.2023.101861; Li D, 2023, A Study on Several Typical Tasks; Li YZ, 2023, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2309.05463; Matos T., 2023, Tuning parameters to train llms (large language models); Pagolu Venkata Sasank, 2016, 2016 International Conference on Signal Processing, Communication, Power and Embedded System (SCOPES), P1345, DOI 10.1109/SCOPES.2016.7955659; Pei Y., 2022, TweetFinSent: A Dataset of Stock Sentiments on Twitter; Priyanka, 2024, GPT 3 vs. GPT 4: What you need to know; Qiu YJ, 2024, INTELL SYST APPL, V21, DOI 10.1016/j.iswa.2023.200308; Samsi S, 2023, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2310.03003, 10.48550/arXiv.2310.03003]; Shah PT, 2024, INT J SYST ASSUR ENG, V15, P2011, DOI 10.1007/s13198-023-02214-6; Sinha A., Impact of News on the Commodity Market: Dataset and Results; Touvron H, 2023, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2302.13971, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2302.13971]; Wen ZH, 2023, Applied and Computational Engineering, V21, P249, DOI [10.54254/2755-2721/21/20231153, 10.54254/2755-2721/21/20231153, DOI 10.54254/2755-2721/21/20231153]; Wu TS, 2022, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 2022 CHI CONFERENCE ON HUMAN FACTORS IN COMPUTING SYSTEMS (CHI' 22), DOI 10.1145/3491102.3517582; Yang HY, 2023, SSRN Electronic Journal, DOI [10.2139/ssrn.4489826, 10.2139/ssrn.4489826, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.4489826]; Yu Tong., 2020, Hyper-parameter optimization: A review of algorithms and applications, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2003.05689",,,,,,,298,,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S),,284,,,,1868-4238,,,,,,"Computer Science, Artificial Intelligence; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications; Computer Science, Theory & Methods"

Specifically, the study investigates a prompt-based LLM framework that processes candlestick charts, comparing its performance with image-based models such as MobileNetV2, Vision Transformer, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as well as models with numerical inputs including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. Although LLMs have demonstrated promising results in stock prediction, directly applying them to stock images poses challenges compared to numerical approaches. To address this, this study further improves LLM performance with post-hoc calibration, reducing prediction biases. Experimental results demonstrate that post-hoc calibrated LLMs with visual input achieve competitive performance compared to other models, highlighting their potential as a viable alternative to traditional stock prediction methods while simplifying the prediction process. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004064224&doi=10.14569%2FIJACSA.2025.0160402&partnerID=40&md5=6efad17433cd9021d66e5df80294117f,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"19 BOLLING RD, BRADFORD, WEST YORKSHIRE, 00000, ENGLAND",,,Article,,,8.0,21565570; 2158107X,,INT J ADV COMPUT SC,,3LU1H,,,59560720800,,Convolutional Neural Network (CNN); Large Language Model (LLM); MobileNetV2; stock price prediction; time series forecasting; vision transformer,,,"Ananthakumar U, 2017, 2017 IEEE 15TH INTL CONF ON DEPENDABLE, AUTONOMIC AND SECURE COMPUTING, 15TH INTL CONF ON PERVASIVE INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING, 3RD INTL CONF ON BIG DATA INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING AND CYBER SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY CONGRESS(DASC/PICOM/DATACOM/CYBERSCI, P1242, DOI 10.1109/DASC-PICom-DataCom-CyberSciTec.2017.199; Bagde A.

Our experiments show that the approach we took outperforms traditional LSTM models and statistical methods, with our best performing model being Llama 3.1. The adaptations we made improve directional accuracy, which is particularly useful for financial applications, while still maintaining computational efficiency.

To aid investors in making informed decisions, systems predicting cryptocurrency market movements have been developed, commonly framed as feature-driven regression problems that focus solely on historical patterns favored by domain experts. However, these methods overlook three critical factors that significantly influence the cryptocurrency market dynamics: 1) the macro investing environment, reflected in major cryptocurrency fluctuations, which can affect investors collaborative behaviors, 2) overall market sentiment, heavily influenced by news, which impacts investors strategies, and 3) technical indicators, which offer insights into overbought or oversold conditions, momentum,and market trends are often ignored despite their relevance in shaping short-term price movements. In this paper, we propose a dual prediction mechanism that enables the model to forecast the next day’s closing price by incorporating macroeconomic fluctuations, technical indicators, and individual cryptocurrency price changes. Furthermore, we introduce a novel refinement mechanism that enhances the prediction through market sentimentbased rescaling and fusion. In experiments, the proposed model achieves state-of-the-art performance (SOTA), consistently outperforming ten comparison methods in most cases.",,,,,,,1 May 2025,,,,,,,,1 May 2025,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,,,,,,,,2573-2978,,,,,,,,,,979-8-3503-6248-0,,,,,1.0,,,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,,,,,40.0,,

Yet, the unique opportunities presented by the cryptocurrency market, noted for its on-chain data's transparency and the critical influence of off-chain signals like news, remain largely untapped by LLMs. This work aims to bridge the gap by developing an LLM-based trading agent, CryptoTrade, which uniquely combines the analysis of on-chain and off-chain data. This approach leverages the transparency and immutability of on-chain data, as well as the timeliness and influence of off-chain signals, providing a comprehensive overview of the cryptocurrency market. CryptoTrade incorporates a reflective mechanism specifically engineered to refine its daily trading decisions by analyzing the outcomes of prior trading decisions. This research makes two significant contributions. Firstly, it broadens the applicability of LLMs to the domain of cryptocurrency trading. Secondly, it establishes a benchmark for cryptocurrency trading strategies. Through extensive experiments, CryptoTrade has demonstrated superior performance in maximizing returns compared to time-series baselines, but not compared to traditional trading signals, across various cryptocurrencies and market conditions.

Lett.,,,"As Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a global asset and discussions around relevant regulations become more active, there is an increasing demand for a comprehensive price prediction framework. To address this necessity, this study aims to enhance the accuracy of Bitcoin price predictions by integrating sentiment information with technical indicators, on-chain data, and cryptocurrency price data. Recognizing Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, the proposed framework incorporates sentiment features derived from both lexicon-based methods and large language models. As unsupervised sentiment tools can introduce label noise particularly in domain-specific or ambiguous financial contexts, this study combines the outputs of multiple sentiment models at the feature level to construct a more stable representation. This design improves the robustness of downstream regression performance and distinguishes the framework from previous hybrid models that relied on a single sentiment source without component-wise evaluation. Experimental results using a dataset spanning 2700 days showed that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model with a 3-day window achieves the best performance with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.93% and R-squared value of 0.99106. Feature importance analysis further demonstrates sentiment index as the most impactful feature, as excluding it resulted in the largest decline in predictive accuracy. Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated under four major volatility periods, revealing MAPE values ranging from 1.49 to 4.03%, highlighting the framework’s practical capability in rapidly adapting to sudden market shifts. In summary, integrating sentiment information attained from multiple language models significantly enhanced prediction accuracy compared to single source approaches. These findings highlight the framework’s practical value for sentiment-informed investment strategies and risk alerts, with a modular design that enables flexible adaptation and potential integration into automated trading systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Dordrecht, English,alohakim@skku.edu,,,,," Large language models , Sentiment analysis , Time series analysis , Bitcoin , Price prediction"," Language , Accuracy , Dictionaries , Deep learning , Performance evaluation , Trends , PSYCHOLOGY , ECONOMICS , Prices , SUSTAINABILITY , SUSTAINABILITY , Digital currencies , Investment strategy , PSYCHOLOGY , Accuracy , OPERATIONS , Large language models , SUSTAINABILITY , PSYCHOLOGY , Sentiment analysis , SUSTAINABILITY , FINANCE , Neural networks , SUSTAINABILITY , ECONOMICS , SUSTAINABILITY , Modular design , Natural language processing , FINANCE , Ablation , Large language models",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013648905&doi=10.1007%2Fs11063-025-11787-1&partnerID=40&md5=272e3e1354e723c836b6053a0761695f,,,,,NPLEF,,,,,,," Seoul National University, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Suwon-si, Korea (GRID:grid.31501.36) (ISNI:0000 0004 0470 5905) , Sungkyunkwan University, Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence/Department of Human-Artificial Intelligence Interaction, Seoul, Korea (GRID:grid.264381.a) (ISNI:0000 0001 2181 989X) , Sungkyunkwan University, Department of Interaction Science/Department of Human-Artificial Intelligence Interaction, Seoul, Korea (GRID:grid.264381.a) (ISNI:0000 0001 2181 989X)",,Scholarly Journals,,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",, English,Article,,hybrid,25.0,13704621;

While previous studies have used multimodal deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs for volatility predicting, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our research introduces a novel framework: ECC Analyzer, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract richer, more predictive content from ECCs to aid the model's prediction performance. We use the pre-trained large models to extract textual and audio features from ECCs and implement a hierarchical information extraction strategy to extract more fine-grained information. This strategy first extracts paragraph-level general information by summarizing the text and then extracts fine-grained focus sentences using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These features are then fused through multimodal feature fusion to perform volatility prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional analytical benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of advanced LLM techniques in financial analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,Ycao33@stevens.edu; zchen100@stevens.edu; qpei1@stevens.edu; nathanlee@hunterschools.org; ksubbala@stevens.edu; pndiaye@stevens.edu,,,,,,,"5th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance, ICAIF 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214883095&doi=10.1145%2F3677052.3698689&partnerID=40&md5=faeaf5880aa1b6968005d5c915cc03ad,,,,979-8-4007-1081-0,,5th International Conference on AI in Finance,"NOV 14-17, 2024",,Brooklyn; NY,,,,,,,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,Conference paper,,,9.0,,,,,BY4IZ,,,57344157600; 58605681600; 59005665600; 59373476900; 6602342476; 7006665118,,Earnings Conference Call Analysis; Large Language Model; Retrieval-Augmented Generation; Volatility forecasting,,,"Abdaljalil Samir, 2021, P 3 WORKSH FIN TECHN, P1; Baevski A, 2020, ADV NEUR IN, V33; Bollen J, 2011, J COMPUT SCI-NETH, V2, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007; Chung JY, 2014, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:1412.3555, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1412.3555]; COX JC, 1976, J FINANC ECON, V3, P145, DOI 10.1016/0304-405X(76)90023-4; Cramer J, 2019, INT CONF ACOUST SPEE, P3852, DOI 10.1109/ICASSP.2019.8682475; Ding X, 2015, PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-FOURTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (IJCAI), P2327; Dumas B, 2009, J FINANC, V64, P579, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2009.01444.x; FOSTER G, 1984, ACCOUNT REV, V59, P574; Franses PH, 1996, J FORECASTING, V15, P229, DOI 10.1002/(SICI)1099-131X(199604)15:3<229::AID-FOR620>3.3.CO;2-V; Gao Tianyu., 2022, arXiv, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2104.08821; Gers FA, 1999, IEE CONF PUBL, P850, DOI [10.1162/089976600300015015, 10.1049/cp:19991218]; HESTON SL, 1993, REV FINANC STUD, V6, P327, DOI 10.1093/rfs/6.2.327; Hoberg G, 2016, J POLIT ECON, V124, P1423, DOI 10.1086/688176; Hsu YL, 2008, MATH COMPUT SIMULAT, V79, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.matcom.2007.09.012; Kim HY, 2018, EXPERT SYST APPL, V103, P25, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2018.03.002; Kimbrough MD, 2005, ACCOUNT REV, V80, P189, DOI 10.2308/accr.2005.80.1.189; Kogan Shimon., 2009, Proceedings of Human Language Technologies: The 2009 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics, P272, DOI DOI 10.3115/1620754.1620794; Koh E, 2021, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2104.06517; Kristjanpoller W, 2014, EXPERT SYST APPL, V41, P2437, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2013.09.043; Lakhani A., 2023, Enhancing customer service with ChatGPT transforming the way businesses interact with customers; Li JZ, 2020, CIKM '20: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 29TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION & KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, P3063, DOI 10.1145/3340531.3412879; Li YH, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AI IN FINANCE, ICAIF 2023, P374, DOI 10.1145/3604237.3626869; Liang PP, 2022, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2209.03430, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2209.03430]; Luong MT, 2016, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:1511.06114, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1511.06114]; Oliveira N, 2017, EXPERT SYST APPL, V73, P125, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2016.12.036; Pons J, 2019, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:1909.06654; Qin Y, 2019, 57TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL 2019), P390; Rajandran K, 2021, CORP COMMUN, V26, P328, DOI 10.1108/CCIJ-03-2020-0051; Rekabsaz N, 2017, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:1702.01978; Sawhney Ramit., 2021, P 59 ANN M ASS COMPU, P6751; Soni V., 2023, Journal of Empirical Social Science Studies, V7, P67; Subagja AD, 2023, Jurnal Minfo Polgan, V12, P380, DOI [10.33395/jmp.v12i1.12407, 10.33395/jmp.v12i1.12407, DOI 10.33395/JMP.V12I1.12407]; Theil CK, 2018, ECONOMICS AND NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING (ECONLP 2018), P32; Wang N, 2021, INTERSPEECH, P3835, DOI 10.21437/Interspeech.2021-2024; Wang SK, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2407.18324; Wang WY, 2014, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 52ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1, P1155; Xie QQ, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2402.12659; Yang Hongyang., 2023, FinGPT: Open-Source Financial Large Language Models; Yang LY, 2020, WEB CONFERENCE 2020: PROCEEDINGS OF THE WORLD WIDE WEB CONFERENCE (WWW 2020), P441, DOI 10.1145/3366423.3380128; Yu YY, 2023, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2311.13743; Zmandar Nadhem, 2021, P 3 FIN NARR PROC W, P99",,,,,,,265,,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),,257,,,,,,,,,,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications"

Syst. Appl.,,,"With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), some studies have explored their potential for predicting stock prices based on financial texts. However, previous research often overlooked the depth of analysis generated by LLMs, resulting in reasoning processes inferior to those of human analysts. In fundamental investing, which requires in-depth company analysis, conclusions from imperfect reasoning lack persuasiveness. In this study, inspired by the analysis process of human analysts, we propose an “Analytical Stage-Based Multi-Agent Framework” to enable LLMs to perform in-depth fundamental analysis. This framework divides the analysis into multiple stages, assigning an LLM agent to each. We enhance each agent's capabilities for its specific task through expert guidance or fine-tuning, allowing them to collectively emulate the workflow of human analysts. Furthermore, we introduce Preference-Anchored Likelihood Adjustment, a new method for fine-tuning LLMs. This approach addresses the decline in likelihood of generating correct responses that occurs after using existing preference alignment methods. It employs an objective function with two terms: one to increase likelihood and another to preserve aligned preference. We conducted experiments using our framework to analyze company earnings releases. We evaluated the analysis quality based on comprehensiveness and logical soundness, while correctness was assessed by using stock prices as the ground truth to calculate the Matthews correlation coefficient and F1 score.

The research assesses the impact of incorporating qualitative sentiment data with quantitative financial models. Key findings indicate that sentiment analysis can significantly refine forecasting accuracy. Specifically, the LSTM model demonstrated a reduction in Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) from 15.59% to 12.75% and an increase in accuracy from 84.41% to 87.25% when sentiment analysis was included. However, the Prophet model showed a decrease in performance, with MAPE increasing to 28.04% and accuracy dropping to 71.96%. The SARIMAX model displayed inconsistent results with sentiment integration.

The development of deep learning methods has evolved from solely considering fundamental price information to a broader spectrum of information, such as sentiment features from news articles. However, these methods often struggle to effectively extract such features when multiple companies are mentioned in a single news article (more details can be referred to Section 1). With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), which can more precisely extract the knowledge people require from text. To overcome the shortcomings of previous work, we propose a novel distillation method for precise knowledge extraction, including sentimental and fine-grained relational knowledge. After that, we incorporate the knowledge as augmented features to assist in the predictions of stock forecasting models. Through experiments on the real Chinese stock market, CSI300 and CSI500, our proposed method can indeed lead to significant improvements in the performance of stock prediction models, demonstrating a performance improvement of baseline models up to 3.23% in terms of accuracy. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,,,,,,,,"5th International Conference on Computer Science and Management Technology, ICCSMT 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85218050013&doi=10.1145%2F3708036.3708236&partnerID=40&md5=8745dbedc53d1fcbd00b8b068274de8e,,,,,,,,,Xiamen,,,,,,,,,,Conference paper,,,,,,,,,,,58879451000; 57204642410; 59487239400; 55320173600; 59287725000; 56404810500,,Deep learning; Knowledge distill; Large language models; Stock prediction,,,,,,,,,,1214,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This paper presents a comprehensive review of machine learning techniques for stock price prediction, examining traditional methods such as regression and ensemble models, as well as advanced approaches that integrate sentiment analysis and textual data sources. With the emergence of powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT, Llama and Gemini, we explore their potential for enhancing predictive accuracy using historical stock data. Key challenges are discussed, including data quality, model interpretability, and adapting to dynamic market conditions. Additionally, this paper proposes a trustworthy stock price prediction model based on LLMs enabling informed investment decision-making. Experimental results demonstrate that ChatGPT-4o model achieved a prediction accuracy of approximately 97%, which can be improved by tuning model parameters. Consequently, the paper highlights the potential of LLMs in improving stock price forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Piscataway, English,,Large Language Models (LLMs);Machine Learning;Stock Price Prediction,26 Mar 2025,,,," Accuracy , SUSTAINABILITY , Risk management , Large language models , Deep learning , Machine learning , Sentiment analysis , Prediction models , Chatbots , Large language models , Chatbots , SUSTAINABILITY , Economic","2024 International Conference on Computer and Applications, ICCA 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105002256773&doi=10.1109%2FICCA62237.2024.10927923&partnerID=40&md5=1ce9521e206b8c3b370915d9ab3395a8,,26 Mar 2025,,,,,,,Cairo,,," Ain Shams University,Faculty of Engineering,Computer and Systems Engineering Department,Cairo,Egypt , Ain Shams University,Faculty of Engineering,Computer and Systems Engineering Department,Cairo,Egypt , Sadat Academy for Management Sciences,Faculty of Computers and Information,Computer Science Department,Cairo,Egypt",,Conference Papers & Proceedings,IEEE,,, English,Conference paper,,,,,,, 2025-03-26,,,,59730115100; 8564437600; 57193403994,,Large Language Models (LLMs); Machine Learning; Stock Price Prediction,979-8-3503-6756-0,,,,,1.0,,,IEEE Conferences,,,,,,,,,, 2024,,,23.0,2024,

Models that encode the time series data to interact with a frozen LLM backbone have been shown to outperform transformers on all benchmark datasets. However, their efficiency on complex datasets, which do not show clear seasonality or trend, remains an open question. In this work, we seek to evaluate the performance of reprogrammed LLMs on the Bitcoin price chart, a financial time series known for its complexity and high volatility. We propose effective methods to improve the performance of Time-LLM, a State-of-the-art (SOTA) method, on such a time series. First, we propose structural improvements to Time-LLM. Second, we suggest an efficient way to handle the non-stationarity of the dataset. Finally, we propose an efficient method for passing additional financial information to the LLM. Our results demonstrate a 50 % improvement on the average percentage loss and a 5 % increase on accuracy of our adapted Time-LLM architecture on Bitcoin data when compared to SOTA models, including the original Time-LLM model. This highlights the impact on forecast accuracy of domain-specific decision making in data processing and feature selection. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,owen.chaffard@cardoai.com; pmolla@outlook.es; marc.cavazza@stir.ac.uk; helmut@nii.ac.jp,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105016463617&doi=10.1016%2Fj.knosys.2025.114449&partnerID=40&md5=238812e0617e1a763a643a97ec91a0a0,,,,,KNSYE,,,,,,,,,,,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,Article,,hybrid,12.0,09507051,,KNOWL-BASED SYST,,7YW3K,,,59367694000; 60105522600; 7007101480; 6701628836,NOV 25,Financial time series; Language models; Time series forecasting,,,"[Anonymous], 2023, Gpt-4 Technical Report, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2303.08774; Ansari A.F., 2024, Trans.

Recognizing challenges such as variable comment quality, redundancy, and authenticity issues, we propose a multimodal architecture that integrates filtered comment data with stock price dynamics and technical indicators. Using data from nine Chinese banks, we compare four filtering models and demonstrate that employing GPT-4 significantly improves financial metrics like profit-loss ratio, win rate, and excess return rate. The multimodal architecture outperforms baseline models by effectively preprocessing comment data and combining it with quantitative financial data. While focused on Chinese banks, the approach can be adapted to broader markets by modifying the prompts of large language models.

In our co-occurrence analysis, we focus on companies that share the same emotion on the same day, using a much shorter horizon than our previous study of one month. This approach allows us to uncover short-term, emotion-driven correlations that traditional models might overlook. By analyzing these co-occurrence networks, Fin-ALICE identifies hidden connections between companies, sectors, and events. Supply chain analysis within Fin-ALICE will evaluate significant events in commodity-producing countries that impact their ability to supply key resources. This analysis captures the ripple effects of disruptions across industries and regions, offering a more nuanced prediction of market movements. Emotional sentiment analysis, powered by the Fin-Emotion library developed in our prior research, quantifies the emotional undertones in financial news through metrics like “emotion magnitude” and “emotion interaction”. These insights, when integrated with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), significantly enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts by capturing the emotional drivers of market sentiment. Key contributions of Fin-ALICE include its ability to perform month-by-month company correlation analysis, capturing short-term market fluctuations and seasonal patterns. We compare the performance of TCNs against advanced models such as LLMs and LSTMs, demonstrating that the Fin-ALICE model outperforms these models, particularly in sectors where emotional sentiment and supply chain dynamics are critical. Fin-ALICE provides decision-makers with predictive insights and a deeper understanding of the underlying emotional and supply chain factors that drive market behaviors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Basel, English,,,, Goldman Sachs Group Inc,," financial market analysis , sentiment analysis , supply chain , time series forecasting , temporal convolutional networks , large language models , emotion interaction"," Language , Accuracy , Deep learning , MARKETING , PSYCHOLOGY , SUSTAINABILITY , Trends , FINANCE , SUSTAINABILITY , Feature selection , SUSTAINABILITY , Linguistics , FINANCE , Correlation analysis , ECONOMICS , SUSTAINABILITY , SUSTAINABILITY , PSYCHOLOGY , Large language models",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85213433591&doi=10.3390%2Fjrfm17120537&partnerID=40&md5=9f59bbb324a01c93a08be2fd39eca9c9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Scholarly Journals,,,, English,Article,,,,19118074,,, 2024-11-26,,, 537,58197260000; 6603532928,,emotion interaction; financial market analysis; large language models; sentiment analysis; supply chain; temporal convolutional networks; time series forecasting,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, 2024,,,,2024,

Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning methods require large training data and often involve encoding various data types into numerical formats for model input, which limits the explainability of model behavior. Recently, LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable advancements in handling multi-modal data, enabling them to execute complex, multi-step decision-making tasks while providing insights into their thought processes. This research introduces a multi-modal multi-agent system designed specifically for financial trading tasks. Our framework employs a team of specialized LLM-based agents, each adept at processing and interpreting various forms of financial data, such as textual news reports, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts. A key feature of our approach is the integration of a reflection module, which conducts analyses of historical trading signals and their outcomes. This reflective process is instrumental in enhancing the decision-making capabilities of the system for future trading scenarios. Furthermore, the ablation studies indicate that the visual reflection module plays a crucial role in enhancing the decision-making capabilities of our framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,sfatem6@uic.edu; yuhenghu@uic.edu,,,,,,,"5th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance, ICAIF 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214878138&doi=10.1145%2F3677052.3698688&partnerID=40&md5=1099ffab70d3031f4af59a519dfcb13f,,,,979-8-4007-1081-0,,5th International Conference on AI in Finance,"NOV 14-17, 2024",,Brooklyn; NY,,,,,,,"1601 Broadway, 10th Floor, NEW YORK, NY, UNITED STATES",,,Conference paper,,Green Submitted,9.0,,,,,BY4IZ,,,58828468800; 38262213400,,Large Language Models; Multi-Agent Framework,,,"[Anonymous], 2023, Gpt-4 Technical Report, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2303.08774; [Anonymous], 2022, OpenAI; Bubeck S, 2023, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2303.12712, 10.48550/arXiv.2303.12712, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2303.12712]; Bybee L, 2023, REV FINANC STUD, V36, P4759, DOI 10.1093/rfs/hhad042; Chang YP, 2024, ACM T INTEL SYST TEC, V15, DOI 10.1145/3641289; Chen JCY, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2309.13007; Cobbe K, 2021, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2110.14168, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2110.14168]; Du YL, 2023, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2305.14325; Du ZY, 2024, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2406.08979, arXiv:2406.08979]; Elhenawy M, 2024, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2407.00092, 10.3390/make6030093, DOI 10.3390/MAKE6030093]; Gou ZB, 2024, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2305.11738, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2305.11738]; Han WG, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 29TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, KDD 2023, P4123, DOI 10.1145/3580305.3599951; Koa KJL, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 32ND ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE MANAGEMENT, CIKM 2023, P1087, DOI 10.1145/3583780.3614844; Li X, 2023, HUM SOC SCI COMMUN, V10, DOI 10.1057/s41599-023-01505-4; Liang WX, 2024, NEJM AI, V1, DOI [10.1056/aioa2400196, 10.1056/AIoa2400196, DOI 10.1056/AIOA2400196]; Mnih V, 2013, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:1312.5602, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1312.5602]; Picasso A, 2019, EXPERT SYST APPL, V135, P60, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2019.06.014; Qian C, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 62ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1: LONG PAPERS, P15174; Qin ML, 2024, AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE, P14669; Ravindran AS, 2023, SCI REP-UK, V13, DOI 10.1038/s41598-023-43871-8; Schulman J, 2017, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:1707.06347; Steinert R, 2023, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2308.16771; Touvron H, 2023, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2302.13971, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2302.13971]; Wen M, 2019, IEEE ACCESS, V7, P28299, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2901842; Xie Q, 2024, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, V36; Xie QQ, 2023, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2304.05351; Xu FZ, 2023, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2306.09841; Yang Hongyang., 2023, FinGPT: Open-Source Financial Large Language Models; Yu XL, 2023, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2306.11025; Yu Yangyang, 2024, P AAAI S SERIES, V3, P595; Zhang BY, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 4TH ACM INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCE ON AI IN FINANCE, ICAIF 2023, P349, DOI 10.1145/3604237.3626866; Zhang C, 2022, IEEE ACCESS, V10, P81364, DOI 10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3195942; Zhang WQ, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2402.17574; Zhang WT, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2402.18485; Zhang Zhuosheng., 2022, arXiv; Zhu XY, 2023, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2210.16257",,,,,,,590,,Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Science (CPCI-S); Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Science &amp; Humanities (CPCI-SSH),,582,,,,,,,,,,"Business, Finance; Computer Science, Interdisciplinary Applications"

This paper explores fine-tuning LLMs for predicting stock returns with financial newsflow. Return prediction is fundamental for quantitative investing tasks like portfolio construction and optimization. We formulate the model to include a text representation and forecasting modules. We propose to compare the encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs, considering they generate text representations in distinct ways. The impact of these different representations on return forecasting remains an open question. Meanwhile, we compare two simple methods of integrating LLMs’ token-level representations into the forecasting module. The experiments on real investment universes reveal that: (1) aggregated representations from LLMs’ token-level embeddings generally produce return predictions that enhance the performance of long-only and long-short portfolios; (2) in the relatively large investment universe, the decoder LLMs-based prediction model leads to stronger portfolios, whereas in the small universes, there are no consistent winners; (3) return predictions derived from LLMs’ text representations are a strong signal for portfolio construction, outperforming conventional sentiment scores. These findings suggest the potential of LLM fine-tuning for enhancing return prediction-based portfolio construction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"Dernoncourt, F.; Preotiuc-Pietro, D.; Shimorina, A.",,,,,,,,,,"2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: Industry Track, EMNLP 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85216806545&doi=10.18653%2Fv1%2F2024.emnlp-industry.77&partnerID=40&md5=2ccbe33a5d5919c4678d9110014341cc,,,,,,,,,Miami; FL,,,,,,,,,,Conference paper,,,,,,,,,,,59801309200; 57219759904,,,,,,,,,,,,1045,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Econ.,,,"The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence, exemplified by tools such as Chat-GPT, has significantly transformed the landscape of stock market analysis. This paper aims to leverage these technological developments to predict the daily returns of the Ibovespa by utilizing predictors derived from technical indicators and sentiment indices extracted from textual data and Chat-GPT-generated sentiment indices. Our findings reveal that the Chat-GPT-based sentiment index does not enhance the out-of-sample prediction of Ibovespa returns. Conversely, the sentiment index derived from financial news data, utilizing a time-varying dictionary, demonstrates improved out-of-sample predictive accuracy for the Ibovespa. Notably, the predictor based on the technical indicator Accumulation–Distribution (AD) outperforms the historical average benchmark, establishing itself as the superior forecasting model. This study contributes to the ongoing discourse on the integration of artificial intelligence and traditional financial analysis, offering insights into the efficacy of sentiment indices and technical indicators for forecasting stock market returns in the Brazilian context. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,diegopitta13@hotmail.com,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85214250696&doi=10.1007%2Fs10614-024-10835-7&partnerID=40&md5=223db74ee084bfcddf46ceff6417c89b,,,,,,,,JAN 2025,,,,,,,,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,Article,,,46.0,15729974; 09277099,,COMPUT ECON,,R4D3M,,,57260261700; 58538112000; 57190410314; 57218354706,2025 JAN 7,Artificial intelligence; Chat-GPT; Ibovespa; Sentiment analysis; Stock market forecasting; Technical indicators,,,"Alhashel BS, 2018, PAC-BASIN FINANC J, V47, P92, DOI 10.1016/j.pacfin.2017.12.005; Antweiler W, 2004, J FINANC, V59, P1259, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2004.00662.x; Baker M, 2006, J FINANC, V61, P1645, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00885.x; Beattie V, 2014, BRIT ACCOUNT REV, V46, P111, DOI 10.1016/j.bar.2014.05.001; BLACK F, 1973, J POLIT ECON, V81, P637, DOI 10.1086/260062; Bollen J, 2011, J COMPUT SCI-NETH, V2, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007; Brown G., 1999, Financial Analysts Journal, V55, P82, DOI DOI 10.2469/FAJ.V55.N2.2263; Camargos M.

This study addresses these challenges by integrating sentiment analysis with advanced deep learning and machine learning architectures within a multi-model framework. Over two thousand financial news headlines were collected from leading economic websites using web scraping tools such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup, forming the basis for sentiment analysis. The sentiment data was processed using cutting edge natural language processing techniques, including Zero-Shot learning with GPT-4 and GEMINI Advanced models, selected for their proficiency in handling unlabeled financial sentiment data. The proposed solution combines sentiment scores with technical and fundamental market indicators, feeding these into diverse predictive models, including Long Short-Term Memory networks, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Transformer architectures in encoder-decoder and decoder-only configurations. This approach captures the nuanced effects of market sentiment within a four-hour trading window, aligning closely with real-time market dynamics. The key findings indicate that integrating sentiment analysis significantly improves prediction accuracy, with the XGBoost model demonstrating superior performance when combined with technical, fundamental, and sentiment data. The study reveals that while this multi-model approach offers improved predictive capabilities, it also faces limitations such as dependency on high-quality sentiment data and the computational intensity of training complex models. These results suggest that the integration of sentiment analysis provides a competitive edge in forex forecasting, though further research is needed to refine these methods and address their limitations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"Ullah, A.; Anwar, S.",,,,,,,,,,"18th International Conference on Information Technology and Applications, ICITA 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009409984&doi=10.1007%2F978-981-96-1758-6_20&partnerID=40&md5=eb2120a8ca667996a4644b3828faff27,,,,,,,,,Sydney; NSW,,,,,,,,,,Conference paper,,,,23673389; 23673370,,,,,,,59830329500; 57207991256; 54942365400,,Forex prediction; LSTM; Sentiment analysis; Transformer; XGBoost,,,,,,,,,,243,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Intell. Inf. Syst.,,,"Stock price prediction is inherently challenging due to market volatility and the influence of external factors. Traditional forecasting methods primarily rely on historical price data, limiting their ability to capture market sentiment embedded in financial news. To address this limitation, we propose MambaMoE, a novel model that integrates historical stock prices with sentiment information extracted from financial news. Specifically, we fine-tune a DeepSeek-based large language model (LLM) for financial sentiment classification and incorporate the extracted sentiment information into our predictive framework. At the core of our approach is MambaMoE layer, which leverages the efficiency of state space models (SSMs) to model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, making it well-suited for financial time series forecasting. Additionally, the Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism improves the model’s ability to capture diverse market behaviors by dynamically selecting specialized experts based on stock data patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that MambaMoE outperforms LSTM-based models by 23.7% and Transformer-based models by 6.3%, highlighting its superior performance in short-term stock prediction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,wangrj23@emails.jlu.edu.cn; smh@jlu.edu.cn,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105012401844&doi=10.1007%2Fs10844-025-00971-3&partnerID=40&md5=ab7eacf17eda5a1395818e2ca388c94e,,,,,JIISE,,,AUG 2025,,,,,,,,"VAN GODEWIJCKSTRAAT 30, 3311 GZ DORDRECHT, NETHERLANDS",,,Article,,,26.0,15737675; 09259902,,J INTELL INF SYST,,5SG2K,,,59187311700; 54795933200; 57137061300,2025 AUG 2,LLM; Mamba; Sentiment analysis; Time series forecasting,,,"Ainslie J, 2023, 2023 CONFERENCE ON EMPIRICAL METHODS IN NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING, EMNLP 2023, P4895; Anthony Q, 2024, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2402.01771, 10.48550/arXiv.2402.01771]; Chen Q., 2024, 2024 IEEE INT C BIG, P4846, DOI [10.1109/BigData62323.2024.10825946, DOI 10.1109/BIGDATA62323.2024.10825946]; Chen S.-A., 2023, Transactions on Machine Learning Research; Cheng DW, 2022, PATTERN RECOGN, V121, DOI 10.1016/j.patcog.2021.108218; Cho KYHY, 2014, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:1406.1078, 10.48550/arXiv.1406.1078, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1406.1078]; Dai DM, 2024, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 62ND ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, VOL 1: LONG PAPERS, P1280; Devlin J, 2019, 2019 CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES (NAACL HLT 2019), VOL. 1, P4171; Dosovitskiy Alexey., 2021, PROC INT C LEARN REP, P2021, DOI [10.48550/arXiv.2010.11929, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2010.11929]; Ekambaram V, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 29TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, KDD 2023, P459, DOI 10.1145/3580305.3599533; El Zaar A, 2025, J INTELL INF SYST, V63, P1233, DOI 10.1007/s10844-025-00937-5; Elfwing S, 2018, NEURAL NETWORKS, V107, P3, DOI 10.1016/j.neunet.2017.12.012; Feng FL, 2019, PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-EIGHTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, P5843; Graves A, 2012, STUD COMPUT INTELL, V385, P1, DOI [10.1007/978-3-642-24797-2, 10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.1]; Gu A, 2024, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2312.00752, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2312.00752, 10.48550/arXiv.2312.00752]; Gu AL, 2022, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2111.00396, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2111.00396]; Gu Albert, 2020, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, V33; Hu E.

This paper explores the novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable financial time series forecasting, addressing challenges in cross-sequence reasoning, multi-modal data integration, and result interpretation that are inherent in traditional approaches. Focusing on NASDAQ-100 stocks, we utilize public historical stock data, company metadata, and economic/financial news. Our experiments employ GPT-4 for zero-shot/few-shot inference and Open LLaMA for instruction-based fine-tuning. The study demonstrates LLMs' ability to generate well-reasoned decisions by leveraging cross-sequence information and extracting insights from text and price time series. We show that our LLM-based approach outperforms classic ARMA-GARCH and gradient-boosting tree models. Furthermore, fine-tuned public LLMs, such as Open-LLaMA, can generate reasonable and explainable forecasts, although they underperform compared to GPT-4. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"Wang, M.; Zitouni, I.",,,,,,,,,,"2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: Industry Track, EMNLP 2023",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85184667082&doi=10.18653%2Fv1%2F2023.emnlp-industry.69&partnerID=40&md5=a2096ecec89ed60cc40729ef88f593c7,,,,,,,,,Singapore,,,,,,,,,,Conference paper,,,,,,,,,,,58476742700; 59283740200; 58315985200,,,,,,,,,,,,753,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Appl.,,,"This study introduces LLM-VaR and LLM-ES, novel risk estimation metrics that utilize general-purpose large language models (LLMs) for the forecasting tasks of Value at Risk (VaR) and Expected Shortfall (ES) in a zero-shot setting. Building on the input encoding mechanism of the LLMTime framework, we extend its application by defining new financial risk measures and performing an empirical evaluation of three generations of GPT models, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and GPT-4o, versus advanced benchmark models such as GARCH with Student innovations and EWMA with Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS). Financial time series are encoded as numerical strings, allowing for model-free inference without requiring retraining. Results show that LLMs perform well when short rolling windows are used, particularly in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. GPT-3.5 frequently outperforms or matches the performance of newer models, raising questions about model complexity, alignment, and biases. In contrast, performance deteriorates with longer windows, where the econometric models prove more reliable. Our findings demonstrate the potential of general-purpose LLMs as adaptive tools for short-horizon financial risk assessment and contribute a first-of-its-kind benchmark for LLM-based VaR/ES estimation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,danpele@ase.ro; vlad.bolovaneanu@ase.ro; linminbin0593@gmail.com; rui.ren.magic@gmail.com; ginavarandrei19@stud.ase.ro; bruno.spilak@gmail.com; ginavarandrei19@stud.ase.ro; mihai.toma@fabiz.ase.ro; stefan.lessmann@hu-berlin.de; haerdle@hu-berlin.de,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105009903193&doi=10.1016%2Fj.eswa.2025.128676&partnerID=40&md5=15fc2364ba9d22162752c15267ffdad4,,,,,ESAPE,,,JUL 2025,,,,,,,,"THE BOULEVARD, LANGFORD LANE, KIDLINGTON, OXFORD OX5 1GB, ENGLAND",,,Article,,hybrid,25.0,09574174,,EXPERT SYST APPL,,4YB2P,,,25960307700; 59533677400; 57211181900; 57208071255; 59533880300; 57221324739; 59451896500; 59663057200; 6506377858; 6701684466,JAN 1,Expected shortfall; GPT; Large language models; LLM-ES; LLM-VaR; Value at risk,,,"Acerbi C., 2014, Risk, V27, P76; Achiam J, 2023, PREPRINT, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2303.08774; Ahmed S, 2023, CIRC SYST SIGNAL PR, V42, P7433, DOI 10.1007/s00034-023-02454-8; Alexander C, 2023, QUANT FINANC, V23, P393, DOI 10.1080/14697688.2022.2159505; An C., 2024, arXiv; Ansari AF, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2403.07815; Basel Committee on Banking Supervision, 1996, Technical Report; Bento J, 2021, KDD '21: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 27TH ACM SIGKDD CONFERENCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY & DATA MINING, P2565, DOI 10.1145/3447548.3467166; Bhatia G., 2024, ANN M ASS COMP LING; Bianchi O, 2025, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2505.18148; BOLLERSLEV T, 1986, J ECONOMETRICS, V31, P307, DOI 10.1016/0304-4076(86)90063-1; Cao R, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2408.04867; Cao YP, 2024, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2404.07452, arXiv:2404.07452]; Christoffersen PF, 1998, INT ECON REV, V39, P841, DOI 10.2307/2527341; Clift S.

Comput.,,,"This study explores the comparative performance of cutting-edge AI models, i.e., Finaance Bidirectional Encoder representations from Transsformers (FinBERT), Generatice Pre-trained Transformer GPT-4, and Logistic Regression, for sentiment analysis and stock index prediction using financial news and the NGX All-Share Index data label. By leveraging advanced natural language processing models like GPT-4 and FinBERT, alongside a traditional machine learning model, Logistic Regression, we aim to classify market sentiment, generate sentiment scores, and predict market price movements. This research highlights global AI advancements in stock markets, showcasing how state-of-the-art language models can contribute to understanding complex financial data. The models were assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that Logistic Regression outperformed the more computationally intensive FinBERT and predefined approach of versatile GPT-4, with an accuracy of 81.83% and a ROC AUC of 89.76%. The GPT-4 predefined approach exhibited a lower accuracy of 54.19% but demonstrated strong potential in handling complex data. FinBERT, while offering more sophisticated analysis, was resource-demanding and yielded a moderate performance. Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna and cross-validation techniques ensured the robustness of the models. This study highlights the strengths and limitations of the practical applications of AI approaches in stock market prediction and presents Logistic Regression as the most efficient model for this task, with FinBERT and GPT-4 representing emerging tools with potential for future exploration and innovation in AI-driven financial analytics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Basel, English,o.shobayo@shu.ac.uk; o.popoola@shu.ac.uk; b.ogunleye@brighton.ac.uk,,,,," FinBERT model , logistic regression , FinBERT , Optuna , time series cross-validation"," Language , Accuracy , FINANCE , Data analysis , OPERATIONS , FINANCE , Accuracy , Investments , SUSTAINABILITY , SUSTAINABILITY , PSYCHOLOGY , Trends , Sentiment analysis , SUSTAINABILITY , Regression models , FINANCE , PSYCHOLOGY , PSYCHOLOGY , Market research , Literature reviews , Machine learning , Natural language processing , Natural language , PSYCHOLOGY",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85210428400&doi=10.3390%2Fbdcc8110143&partnerID=40&md5=7583450a30ccf1dfdbe524ab4af2cb16,,,,,,,,,,,," School of Computing and Digital Technologies, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield S1 2NU, UK<email>o.popoola@shu.ac.uk</email> (O.P.) , School of Computing and Digital Technologies, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield S1 2NU, UK<email>o.popoola@shu.ac.uk</email> (O.P.) , School of Computing and Digital Technologies, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield S1 2NU, UK<email>o.popoola@shu.ac.uk</email> (O.P.) , Department of Computing & Mathematics, University of Brighton, Brighton BN2 4GJ, UK; <email>b.ogunleye@brighton.ac.uk</email>",,Scholarly Journals,,"ST ALBAN-ANLAGE 66, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",, English,Article,,"Green Submitted, gold",21.0,25042289,,BIG DATA COGN COMPUT, 2024-10-25,N4D6X,, 143,57204632324; 59441684700; 57195674817; 58070023000,NOV,FinBERT; FinBERT model; logistic regression; Optuna; time series cross-validation,,,"[Anonymous], 2022, Financial Text Classification with Deep Learning Using FinBERT; Atak A, 2023, BORSA ISTANB REV, V23, pS84, DOI 10.1016/j.bir.2023.12.010; Bafitlhile K.D., 2022, Masters Thesis; Bagate R., 2022, P 6 INT C ADV COMP I, P241; Chen TY, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2404.08681; Chen Zixiao, 2023, Proceedings of China SAE Congress 2021: Selected Papers.

Behav. Financ.,,,"This study explores whether sentiment extracted from financial news using large language models (LLMs) can predict abnormal intraday stock returns following dividend announcements. Drawing on 4,682 news items linked to 1,258 announcements from 394 S&P 500 companies (January 2023–January 2024), we use ChatGPT to extract sentiment polarity scores and we apply different models to forecast cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) in 30-minute intervals. Our findings reveal that sentiment–especially when captured immediately after news releases–has significant predictive power over intraday price movements. Strategies based on ChatGPT-derived sentiment consistently outperform benchmark models, particularly within the first two hours of trading. These results remain robust across alternative specifications and placebo tests, highlighting the value of LLMs for real-time market prediction.

In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a large language model (LLM), a Linear Transformer (LT), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance stock price prediction using solely historical market data. The framework leverages the LLM as a professional financial analyst to perform daily technical analysis. The technical indicators, including moving averages (MAs), relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands (BBs), are calculated directly from historical stock data. These indicators are then analyzed by the LLM, generating descriptive textual summaries. The textual summaries are further transformed into vector representations using FinBERT, a pre-trained financial language model, to enhance the dataset with contextual insights. The FinBERT embeddings are integrated with features from two additional branches: the Linear Transformer branch, which captures long-term dependencies in time-series stock data through a linearized self-attention mechanism, and the CNN branch, which extracts spatial features from visual representations of stock chart data. The combined features from these three modalities are then processed by a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) for final stock price prediction. Experimental results on the S&P 500 dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves stock prediction accuracy by effectively capturing temporal, spatial, and contextual dependencies in the data. This multimodal approach highlights the importance of integrating advanced technical analysis with deep learning architectures for enhanced financial forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Basel, English,lei.zhou@autuni.ac.nz; yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz; jian.yu@aut.ac.nz; wangguiling@ncut.edu.cn; zhizhongliu@ytu.edu.cn; sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz; nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz,,,,," stock price prediction , Linear Transformer , CNN , LLM , deep learning , financial forecasting"," Language , FINANCE , Accuracy , SUSTAINABILITY , Deep learning , Wavelet transforms , SUSTAINABILITY , SUSTAINABILITY , Trends , Artificial neural networks , PSYCHOLOGY , Indicators , SUSTAINABILITY , Machine learning , Representations , FINANCE , Data analysis , OPERATIONS , Datasets , Spatial data , Large language models , PSYCHOLOGY , Summaries , FINANCE , Neural networks , Support vector machines , Standardization , Deep learning , Predictions , Large language models",,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85217663167&doi=10.3390%2Fmath13030487&partnerID=40&md5=e64ebf3b118ccb401b6df31a71efd0c4,,,Y,,,,,,,,," Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.) , Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.) , Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.) , School of Information Science and Technology, North China University of Technology, Beijing 100144, China; <email>wangguiling@ncut.edu.cn</email> , The School of Computer and Control Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai 254005, China; <email>zhizhongliu@ytu.edu.cn</email> , Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.) , Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.)",,Scholarly Journals,,"MDPI AG, Grosspeteranlage 5, CH-4052 BASEL, SWITZERLAND",, English,Article,,gold,18.0,22277390,,MATHEMATICS-BASEL, 2025-01-31,W4V3Z,, 487,59462061600; 58409773400; 56962735000; 55783286700; 55714636500; 26968166900; 57881117700,FEB,CNN; deep learning; financial forecasting; Linear Transformer; LLM; stock price prediction,,,"Bao W, 2017, PLOS ONE, V12, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0180944; Bollen J, 2011, J COMPUT SCI-NETH, V2, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007; Brown TB, 2020, ADV NEUR IN, V33; Cheng J., 2018, IEEE Access, V6, P72832; Darapaneni N., 2022, arXiv; Deng YQ, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2407.09003; Feng F., 2018, P 27 ACM INT C INF K, P1539; Graves A, 2012, STUD COMPUT INTELL, V385, P1, DOI [10.1007/978-3-642-24797-2, 10.1162/neco.1997.9.1.1]; Halder S., 2022, PREPRINT, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2211.07392; Ince H, 2008, INT J GEN SYST, V37, P677, DOI 10.1080/03081070601068595; Jiang WW, 2021, EXPERT SYST APPL, V184, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2021.115537; Kim T, 2019, PLOS ONE, V14, DOI 10.1371/journal.pone.0212320; Li H., 2020, P 34 AAAI C ART INT, VVolume 2, P4644; Liu J., 2019, J Sci Humanit, V6, P1, DOI DOI 10.6535/JSH2019086(4).0001; Merello J., 2019, Int.

With the emergence of deep learning and artificial intelligence, researchers have proposed various methods to predict stock market directions, considering different financial variables. One of the most significant variables influencing stock movement is user opinions and social media, which has attracted much attention from researchers in recent years. Although existing studies have introduced various methods to combine stock price and textual features, a reliable and comprehensive method has not yet been established, and there is still room for improvement. In this research, a novel method based on large language models is introduced for feature extraction from financial texts, and a self-attention mechanism is proposed to capture the internal relationships between textual and financial features.

To represent this complexity, researchers have utilized multi-source data, such as financial news and macro market indicators, for better performance. However, these efforts often ignore the internal knowledge among these data or suffer from the high cost of acquiring diverse knowledge. Thus, we propose a LLM-driven knowledge enhancement method for securities index prediction. Specifically, we collect the daily data of Shanghai Stock Exchange indexes and their related market indicators and model the internal knowledge among them as triplets. Then we leverage LLM as a knowledge base to acquire diverse knowledge efficiently. Finally, we integrate the knowledge and numeric multi-source data as a heterogeneous graph and apply a GNN model to predict the trend of securities indexes.

Traditional time series statistical models often struggle to capture complex nonlinear dependencies and market signals embedded in unstructured data. With advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), it is now possible to integrate textual information from financial news, social media, and earnings reports to enhance predictive accuracy. In this study, we leverage the LLaMA family of LLMs to improve stock price forecasting by combining historical price with news. We evaluate the performance of LLaMA 3.3 against LLaMA 3.1 and the benchmark ARIMA model to assess its effectiveness in capturing time series patterns and textual signals. Our results indicate that LLaMA 3.3 outperforms both LLaMA 3.1 and ARIMA, demonstrating its superior capability in modeling complex financial relationships. Additionally, our analysis confirms that market sentiment has an impact on stock returns, with sentiments influencing short-term price fluctuations. By incorporating news sentiment in LLMs prompt, we achieve improved forecasts compared to models without news. This highlights the importance of integrating both structured (numerical time series) and unstructured (news sentiment) data for enhanced financial modeling. Our findings suggest that LLM-driven forecasting methods hold substantial promise for traders, analysts, and financial institutions seeking more accurate market predictions. Future work will explore fine-tuning LLaMA models for domain-specific financial tasks and improving interpretability in decision making processes.",,,,,takrahul24@stud.ase.ro; danpele@ase.ro,,,,,,,,,,,,,,19th International Conference on Business Excellence (ICBE) - Leading Change in Disruptive Times,"MAR 20-22, 2025",,,,,,,,,"BOGUMILA ZUGA 32A, WARSAW, MAZOVIA, POLAND",,,,,,12.0,,,P INT CONF BUS EXCEL,,5OO2B,,,,JUL 1,LLMs; LLaMA; ARIMA; News Sentiment; Time series forecasting; Stock Price,,,"Alamsyah A., 2019, 2019 7 INT C INF COM, P1; Andersen T., 2009, Handbook of financial time series; [Anonymous], 2023, Gpt-4 Technical Report, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2303.08774; Ansari AF, 2024, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:2403.07815; Chang M., 2018, How A.I.

However, the finance sector presents a distinct challenge due to its dependence on time-series data for complex forecasting tasks. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called LLMFactor, which employs Sequential Knowledge-Guided Prompting (SKGP) to identify factors that influence stock movements using LLMs. Unlike previous methods that relied on keyphrases or sentiment analysis, this approach focuses on extracting factors more directly related to stock market dynamics, providing clear explanations for complex temporal changes. Our framework directs the LLMs to create background knowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential factors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background knowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in textual format to predict stock movement. An extensive evaluation of the LLMFactor framework across four benchmark datasets from both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrates its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods and its effectiveness in financial time-series forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",Apple; et al.; LG AI Research; Megagon Labs; Meta AI; NewsBreak,"Ku, L.-W.; Martins, A.; Srikumar, V.",,,omiun20@g.ecc.u-tokyo.ac.jp; izumi@sys.t.u-tokyo.ac.jp; sakaji@ist.hokudai.ac.jp,,,,,,,"Findings of the 62nd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, ACL 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85205316331&doi=10.18653%2Fv1%2F2024.findings-acl.185&partnerID=40&md5=05a7d5867c2886506f6cf039d9823e08,,,,979-8-89176-099-8,,62nd Annual Meeting of the Association-for-Computational-Linguistics (ACL) / Student Research Workshop (SRW),"AUG 11-16, 2024",,"Hybrid, Bangkok",,,,"Martins, A; Srikumar, V; Ku, LW",,,"209 N EIGHTH STREET, STROUDSBURG, PA 18360 USA",,,Conference paper,,,12.0,0736587X,,,,BY0KA,,,58640745000; 7203048296; 24339329000,,,,,"Ahbali N, 2022, 2022 CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS, NAACL-HLT 2022, P362; Ang Gary, 2022, Long Papers, V1, P6313; Araci D, 2019, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:1908.10063, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1908.10063, 10.48550/arXiv.1908.10063]; Bertrand A, 2023, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 6TH ACM CONFERENCE ON FAIRNESS, ACCOUNTABILITY, AND TRANSPARENCY, FACCT 2023, P943, DOI 10.1145/3593013.3594053; Boudin Florian., 2016, Proceedings of COLING 2016, the 26th International Conference on Computational Linguistics: System Demonstrations, P69; Bougouin A., 2013, P INT JOINT C NAT LA; Brown TB, 2020, ADV NEUR IN, V33; Campos R, 2020, INFORM SCIENCES, V509, P257, DOI 10.1016/j.ins.2019.09.013; FAMA EF, 1970, J FINANC, V25, P383, DOI 10.2307/2325486; Feng FL, 2019, ACM T INFORM SYST, V37, DOI 10.1145/3309547; Gruver Nate, 2023, 37 C NEURAL INFORM; Hao PY, 2021, APPL SOFT COMPUT, V98, DOI 10.1016/j.asoc.2020.106806; Henrique BM, 2019, EXPERT SYST APPL, V124, P226, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2019.01.012; Hsu YL, 2023, IEEE T KNOWL DATA EN, V35, P469, DOI 10.1109/TKDE.2021.3079496; Kong Aobo, 2023, Long Papers, V1, P9788; Lewis P, 2020, ADV NEUR IN, V33; Li W, 2020, PROCEEDINGS OF THE TWENTY-NINTH INTERNATIONAL JOINT CONFERENCE ON ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE, P4541; Liu JC, 2022, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 60TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL 2022), VOL 1: (LONG PAPERS), P3154; Liu PF, 2023, ACM COMPUT SURV, V55, DOI 10.1145/3560815; Lo A W., 2004, Journal of Portfolio Management; Luo Di, 2023, Long Papers, V1, P12164; Maarten Grootendorst, 2020, Keybert: Minimal key-word extraction with bert; Mihalcea R., 2004, Proceedings of EMNLP, P404, DOI DOI 10.3115/1219044.1219064; Patel J, 2015, EXPERT SYST APPL, V42, P259, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2014.07.040; Sparck-Jones K, 2004, J DOC, V60, P493, DOI [10.1108/00220410410560573, 10.1108/eb026526]; Nguyen TH, 2015, EXPERT SYST APPL, V42, P9603, DOI 10.1016/j.eswa.2015.07.052; Timmermann A, 2004, INT J FORECASTING, V20, P15, DOI 10.1016/S0169-2070(03)00012-8; Vargas MR, 2018, IEEE IJCNN; Wan X., 2008, COLLABRANK COLLABORA, P969, DOI DOI 10.3115/1599081.1599203; Wan XC, 2021, SCI REP-UK, V11, DOI 10.1038/s41598-021-82338-6; Wang HY, 2020, AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE, V34, P971; Wang JJ, 2022, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:2209.02970, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2209.02970]; Wang ZC, 2021, AAAI CONF ARTIF INTE, V35, P643; Wei JS, 2022, ADV NEUR IN; Xu Ming, 2023, pke_zh: Python keyphrase extraction toolkit for chinese; Xu YM, 2018, PROCEEDINGS OF THE 56TH ANNUAL MEETING OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS (ACL), VOL 1, P1970; Xue H., 2023, IEEE Trans.

The study employs three distinct text summarization methods to efficiently process a substantial volume of financial news. This approach enhances the depth and accuracy of subsequent sentiment analysis. Sentiment is assessed through a combination of lexicon-based and deep learning methods. These insights, along with technical market data, are integrated into a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model, which is refined through Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and assessed via cross-validation. The results demonstrate that the model’s performance peaks at a standard deviation coefficient of 0.25, indicating an optimal balance for the three-class classification problem. Furthermore, the feature importance analysis reveals that while temporal and market-related factors play a significant role, sentiment features captured by FinBERT and VADER substantially contribute to the model’s predictive power. A notable finding of this research is the superior performance of FinBERT over GPT-3.5 in feature importance analysis, underscoring the efficacy of specialized language models in financial contexts. By marrying natural language processing techniques with machine learning, the study presents a novel approach to understanding the predictive power of news sentiment in financial markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"Arai, K.",,,farshid.balaneji@unibas.ch,,,,,,,"Intelligent Systems Conference, IntelliSys 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85201122987&doi=10.1007%2F978-3-031-66336-9_31&partnerID=40&md5=2ed7515979273795c0f74502e9434d6b,,,,978-3-031-66335-2; 978-3-031-66336-9,,Intelligent Systems Conference,"SEP 05-06, 2024",,Amsterdam,,,,"Arai, K",,,"GEWERBESTRASSE 11, CHAM, CH-6330, SWITZERLAND",,,Conference paper,,,20.0,23673389; 23673370,,LECT NOTE NETW SYST,,BX6QR,,,57716344300,,Feature importance; Financial forecasting; LGBM; Sentiment analysis; Text summarization,,,"Akiba T, 2019, KDD'19: PROCEEDINGS OF THE 25TH ACM SIGKDD INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCCE ON KNOWLEDGE DISCOVERY AND DATA MINING, P2623, DOI 10.1145/3292500.3330701; Araci D, 2019, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:1908.10063, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1908.10063, 10.48550/arXiv.1908.10063]; Bahdanau D, 2016, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:1409.0473; Brown TB, 2020, ADV NEUR IN, V33; Conrad J, 2002, J FINANC, V57, P2507, DOI 10.1111/1540-6261.00504; Devlin J, 2019, 2019 CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES (NAACL HLT 2019), VOL. 1, P4171; Fatouros G, 2023, MACH LEARN APPL, V14, DOI 10.1016/j.mlwa.2023.100508; George AShaji., 2023, Partners Universal Int.

Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process. However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others. On the other hand, to fine-tune LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale. To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a verbal self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that allow a LLM teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions, in a fully autonomous manner. The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through a self-reasoning process, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations given the input texts at test-time. The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators. Using our SEP framework, we fine-tune a specialized LLM that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient, for the stock classification task. To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.

To address this gap, we investigate how LLMs can predict price movements in stock and bond portfolios using economic indicators, enabling portfolio adjustments akin to those employed by institutional investors. Additionally, we explore the impact of incorporating different personas within LLMs, using an ensemble approach to leverage their diverse predictions. Our findings show that LLM-based strategies, especially when combined with the mode ensemble, outperform the buy-and-hold strategy in terms of Sharpe ratio during periods of rising consumer price index (CPI).

This work focuses on the new approach to the stock options valuation by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of quantitative (i.e. financial features-lagged prices, moving averages, and volatility indicators) and qualitative data (i.e. news data, including article titles, full textual content, and publication dates). More specifically, our approach fuses sentiment analysis from LLMs applied to financial news from two reputable outlets (i.e. Economic Times and Yahoo Finance India) with quantitative data on stock options, which includes stock option closing price. By conducting experiments on companies from the NIFTY 50 index using ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and LLaMA 3.1, we show that our method achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to other similar approaches. The paper develops a new framework to improve the valuation of short-term stock options using advanced natural language processing behaviors afforded by LLMs to achieve a more holistic capture of market dynamics and sentiment in option pricing. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"He, Y.;

The research evaluates linear regression models against ML models, such as Random Forests, Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost), Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LightGBM), and Category Boosting (CatBoost), within five- and six-factor frameworks. Empirical results show that the ChatGPT Score outperforms traditional sentiment tools like SnowNLP and improves the predictive accuracy of the FF5 model. Additionally, CatBoost and Random Forests demonstrate strong portfolio management capabilities. Statistical validation through retrospective analysis confirms the effectiveness of the models, while industry feedback highlights their practical value in investment strategies.

Traditional fine-tuning methods struggle to overcome challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio in numerical time-series data and complex dynamic patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient adaptation framework LLaMA-TTPT for frozen LLMs. LLaMA-TTPT addresses the limitations of utilization efficiency and robustness with multi-modal prompt, cross attention and layer-wise hierarchical prompt propagation. The core innovation of this paper is implicitly mapping temporal data into the semantic space of pretrained LLMs. Firstly, we proposed a temporal-text prompt fine-tuning mechanism, which employes trainable numerical encoders and text prompts to convert stock price sequences into LLM-aligned multi-modal inputs. This enhances cross-modal consistency between numerical features and semantic descriptions. Secondly, we adopt cross attention mechanism to fuse dual-modal embeddings. Finally, we propose a temporal-aware hierarchical soft prompt propagation structure. It combines local dynamic prompt with global trend features extracted through LLMs' self-attention, enabling collaborative modeling of long-short term dependencies.

This paper explores a multimodal machine learning approach for stock price prediction by combining data from diverse sources, including traditional financial metrics, tweets, and news articles. We capture real-time market dynamics and investor mood through sentiment analysis on these textual data using both ChatGPT-4o and FinBERT models. We look at how these integrated data streams augment predictions made with a standard Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM model) to illustrate the extent of performance gains. Our study's results indicate that incorporating the mentioned data sources considerably increases the forecast effectiveness of the reference model by up to 5%. We also provide insights into the individual and combined predictive capacities of these modalities, highlighting the substantial impact of incorporating sentiment analysis from tweets and news articles. This research offers a systematic and effective framework for applying multimodal data analytics techniques in financial time series forecasting that provides a new perspective for investors to leverage data for decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"Rocha, A.P.; Steels, L.; van den Herik, H.J.",,,,,,,,,,"17th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence, ICAART 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001934606&doi=10.5220%2F0013174500003890&partnerID=40&md5=84d2a5b270cd624cdff11a31b3bc3aaa,,,,,,,,,Porto,,,,,,,,,,Conference paper,,,,21843589; 2184433X,,,,,,,59637874300; 43260940300; 57947593100,,Deep Learning; Deep Neural Networks; Financial Forecasting; Large Language Models; Multimodal Machine Learning; Stock Market Prediction,,,,,,,,,,694,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Previous studies have used time-series analysis on historical prices or sentiment analysis on textual information. However, these methods often fail to capture the dynamic interactions between text and time-series modalities and overlook the different perspectives embedded in textual data. To address these limitations, we propose the pleno-alignment framework (PAFrame) that enhances multimodal stock information through intermodal and intramodal alignment to capture market dynamics. Our framework first integrates textual and time-series data in a shared representation space to learn modal-invariant information. To tackle divergent sentiments in textual data, we employ a contrastive learning approach to extract abstract semantic meanings from objective and subjective perspectives, thereby improving the robustness of language representations. Finally, we use a hybrid approach that explicitly combines cross-attention mechanisms to create a unified representation and utilizes prompts to implicitly guide language models with numerical financial indicators for final prediction. Our comprehensive experiments on five real-world datasets show that PAFrame outperforms existing methods in predicting stock trends.",,,,,,Contrastive learning;language model;multimodal;stock trend prediction;time series,4 Sep 2025,,,,,,,,1 May 2025,,,,,,,,,,,,,IEEE,,,,,,,,2162-2388,1.0,,,,,,,,Market research;Predictive models;Social networking (online);Accuracy;Stock markets;Analytical models;Data mining;Biological system modeling;Time series analysis;Semantics;Contrastive learning;language model;multimodal;stock trend prediction;time series,,,,,,16604.0,,,IEEE Journals,,,,,,,,,,,,,71.0,,

In this article, we propose a novel multi-modal deep learning-based method to improve predictions of stock market trends. This study uses an integrated framework of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, deep learning with LLM, and RAG. We use data retrieval techniques, such as web scraping, to download financial reports containing corporate balance sheets. Further, our method includes real-time sentiment analysis in order to understand the investors' current mentality which can be crucial in determining the market movements. Technical analysis uses deep learning models to interpret important indicators such as RSI, MACD, CCI, and Stochastic oscillators to uncover underlying patterns and correlations in stock trends. Our experiments demonstrate that this integrated strategy performs better than conventional single-dimensional techniques. We are combining data from corporate financial, sentiment analysis, and technical factors as well as active news sentiment analysis to improve the accuracy and reliability of market predictions by demonstrating the performance of a combined set of data sources. This work draws attention to the importance of the multifaceted integration of data by demonstrating RAG benefits for accurate financial data retrieval and multi-modal analysis in the practical applications of stock markets. The results demonstrate how these new approaches can be combined for profit maximization with better decision-making and risk reduction in financial markets. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Piscataway, English,,Stock prediction;multi-modal deep learning;LLM;RAG;news sentiment analysis;financial data;and technical indicators,29 Jul 2025,,," Deep learning , Sentiment analysis , Accuracy , Soft sensors , Predictive models , Data retrieval , Market research , Data models , Numerical models , Stock markets , Stock prediction , multi-modal deep learning , LLM , RAG , news sentiment analysis , financial data , and technical indicators"," Risk management , Deep learning , PSYCHOLOGY , Trends , Trends , Sentiment analysis , FINANCE , Modal analysis , Deep learning , Machine learning , Real time , SUSTAINABILITY , Data retrieval , Data collection , Information retrieval , Economic","11th International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing, ICCSP 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013460118&doi=10.1109%2FICCSP64183.2025.11088423&partnerID=40&md5=d2ac074a089b5553728f27ac5411200f,,29 Jul 2025,,,,,,,Melmaruvathur,,," Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Amrita School of Computing,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,India , Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Amrita School of Computing,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,India , Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Amrita School of Computing,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,India , Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Amrita School of Computing,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,India",,Conference Papers & Proceedings,IEEE,,, English,Conference paper,,,,2836-1873,,, 2025-07-29,,, 849,60050395200; 60051085500; 60050395300; 56405367200,,and technical indicators; financial data; LLM; multi-modal deep learning; news sentiment analysis; RAG; Stock prediction,978-1-6654-5736-1,,,,,849.0,,,IEEE Conferences,854,,,,,,,,, 2025,,,22.0,2025,

Traditional methods like content based and collaborative filtering work well for smaller datasets but often fail to extract information from large datasets due to their limited ability to capture complex patterns. This paper introduces a novel approach for stock recommendation that leverages a large language model, Llama 3.1, fine-tuned on financial news data. Financial news headlines and summaries were collected using the FinnHub API which served as the primary dataset. The system integrates stock price forecasting, sentiment analysis, and performance indicators to generate an effective analysis for decision making. The forecasting algorithm generates the stock price predictions which were integrated with sentiment analysis and stock performance indicators to create an informative prompt-response dataset for fine-tuning. The proposed system ranks stocks based on positive developments, potential concerns, and forecasted closing prices, providing Buy or Sell recommendations. Experimental results demonstrated moderate performance for predicting Buy recommendations, while Sell predictions exhibited lower accuracy comparatively. Analysis based on sectors revealed that the consumer cyclical and healthcare sectors yielded the best performance for Buy and Sell recommendations, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Piscataway, English,,Recommender Systems;Large Language Models;Ranking Algorithm,23 Apr 2025,,,," Datasets , SUSTAINABILITY , Recommender systems , Large language models , PSYCHOLOGY , Sentiment analysis , Recommender systems , News , Indicators , Communications systems , Algorithms , Predictions , Forecasting , MANAGEMENT , Economic","14th IEEE International Conference on Communication Systems and Network Technologies, CSNT 2025",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105004551417&doi=10.1109%2FCSNT64827.2025.10967744&partnerID=40&md5=d1b34ba90a42daf2dc6d3b202ede38af,,23 Apr 2025,,,,,,,"Hybrid, Bhopal",,," PES University,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Bengaluru,India , PES University,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Bengaluru,India , PES University,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Bengaluru,India , PES University,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Bengaluru,India , PES University,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,Bengaluru,India",,Conference Papers & Proceedings,IEEE,,, English,Conference paper,,,,2473-5655,,, 2025-04-23,,,,59789650700; 59793206400; 59787305400; 59786115600; 57190342965,,Large Language Models; Ranking Algorithm; Recommender Systems,979-8-3315-3193-5,,,,,868.0,,,IEEE Conferences,872,,,,,,,,, 2025,,,14.0,2025,

Relying solely on empirical analysis often yields unsustainable and ineffective results. Machine learning researchers have demonstrated that the application of random forest algorithm can enhance predictions in this context, playing a crucial auxiliary role in forecasting stock trends. This study introduces a new approach to stock market prediction by integrating sentiment analysis using FinGPT generative AI model with the traditional Random Forest model. The proposed technique aims to optimize the accuracy of stock price forecasts by leveraging the nuanced understanding of financial sentiments provided by FinGPT. We present a new methodology called “Sentiment-Augmented Random Forest” (SARF), which incorporates sentiment features into the Random Forest framework. Our experiments demonstrate that SARF outperforms conventional Random Forest and LSTM models with an average accuracy improvement of 9.23% and lower prediction errors in predicting stock market movements. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"Perakovic, D.; Knapcikova, L.",,,,,,,,,,"8th EAI International Conference on Future Access Enablers of Ubiquitous and Intelligent Infrastructures, FABULOUS 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85207644175&doi=10.1007%2F978-3-031-72393-3_5&partnerID=40&md5=0de5304d3fd48d3d7d4ec25b8517f47c,,,,,,,,,Zagreb,,,,,,,,,,Conference paper,,,,18678211; 1867822X,,,,,,,59387480200; 6507543478,,Large Language Model; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Random Forest; Sentiment Analysis; Stock Price Prediction,,,,,,,,,,64,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

To make this analysis more effective, we employed ChatGPT. First, from the summary of daily financial updates, we identify top global news headlines that could have a significant influence on stock markets. Second, for each headline, we questioned ChatGPT to answer whether the news might lead to a rise, a fall in stock prices or an indecisive future. This two-stage method proves more effective than a direct question on the entire text. By gathering ChatGPT's predictions day by day, we formed an overall market sentiment score and transform this score into a practical investment strategy in the NASDAQ index, demonstrating the significance of minimizing noise in sentiment scores by initially accumulating and then detrending them. This approach showcases that ChatGPT's analysis of news headlines can provide valuable insights into future stock market behaviours and be a valuable tool to develop intuitive NLP-driven investment strategies leveraging news predictive power. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"He, Y.; Hamidouche, W.; Razzak, I.; Hacid, H.; Panov, M.", Piscataway, English,baptiste.lefort@aiforalpha.com,NLP;ChatGPT;SentimentScore;Bloomberg News,18 Mar 2025,,,," News , Data mining , SUSTAINABILITY , Chatbots , FINANCE , Chatbots , Investment strategy , Economic","24th IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops, ICDMW 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001364338&doi=10.1109%2FICDMW65004.2024.00021&partnerID=40&md5=d5029c435e4113bdc295f2f5ff8ea4b9,,18 Mar 2025,,979-8-3315-3064-8; 979-8-3315-3063-1,,24th International Conference on Data Mining Workshops,"DEC09, 2024",,Abu Dhabi,,," AI for Alpha and CentraleSupelec , AI for Alpha,Paris,France , AI for Alpha,Paris,France , AI for Alpha,Paris,France , AI for Alpha,Paris,France","He, Y; Hamidouche, W; Razzak, I; Hacid, H; Panov, M",Conference Papers & Proceedings,IEEE,"10662 LOS VAQUEROS CIRCLE, PO BOX 3014, LOS ALAMITOS, CA 90720-1264 USA",, English,Conference paper,,,6.0,23759259; 23759232,,INT CONF DAT MIN WOR, 2025-03-18,BY5PV,,,58827579100; 57219457827; 57221150081; 57219460079; 57219624094,,Bloomberg News; ChatGPT; NLP; SentimentScore,979-8-3315-3063-1,,"Achiam J, 2023, PREPRINT, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2303.08774; Arner DW, 2015, SSRN Electronic Journal, DOI [10.2139/ssrn.2676553, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.2676553, 10.2139/ssrn.2676553]; Baker Scott E., 2021, Technical Report; Cowen T., 2023, SSRN Electronic Journal, VXXX, P3; Devlin J, 2019, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:1810.04805, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1810.04805]; Fatouros Georgios, 2023, Digit Finance, V5, P29, DOI [10.1007/s42521-022-00050-0, 10.1007/s42521-022-00050-0]; George AShaji., 2023, Partners Universal Int.

Our findings reveal that the GPT-3-based OPT model significantly outperforms the others, predicting stock market returns with an accuracy of 74.4%. A long-short strategy based on OPT, accounting for 10 basis points (bps) in transaction costs, yields an exceptional Sharpe ratio of 3.05. From August 2021 to July 2023, this strategy produces an impressive 355% gain, outperforming other strategies and traditional market portfolios. This underscores the transformative potential of LLMs in financial market prediction and portfolio management and the necessity of employing sophisticated language models to develop effective investment strategies based on news sentiment. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,,,,kemal.kirtac.21@ucl.ac.uk,,,,,,,,https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85188957331&doi=10.1016%2Fj.frl.2024.105227&partnerID=40&md5=c2a4b1392694a6d849ea6a7955dd4f7b,,,,,,,,MAR 2024,,,,,,,,"525 B ST, STE 1900, SAN DIEGO, CA 92101-4495 USA",,,Article,,"Green Submitted, hybrid",9.0,15446123,,FINANC RES LETT,,QA4B9,,,58858934500; 7102798637,APR,Artificial intelligence investment strategies; Generative pre-trained transformer (GPT); Large language models; Machine learning in stock return prediction; Natural language processing (NLP),,,"Acemoglu D, 2022, J LABOR ECON, V40, pS293, DOI 10.1086/718327; Alain G, 2018, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:1610.01644; Baker M, 2006, J FINANC, V61, P1645, DOI 10.1111/j.1540-6261.2006.00885.x; Baker SR, 2016, Q J ECON, V131, P1593, DOI 10.1093/qje/qjw024; Bybee L, 2019, SSRN Electronic Journal, DOI [10.2139/ssrn.3446225, 10.2139/ssrn.3446225, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.3446225]; Calomiris CW, 2019, J FINANC ECON, V133, P299, DOI 10.1016/j.jfineco.2018.11.009; Campbell JL, 2014, REV ACCOUNT STUD, V19, P396, DOI 10.1007/s11142-013-9258-3; Carhart MM, 1997, J FINANC, V52, P57, DOI 10.2307/2329556; Devlin J, 2019, 2019 CONFERENCE OF THE NORTH AMERICAN CHAPTER OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR COMPUTATIONAL LINGUISTICS: HUMAN LANGUAGE TECHNOLOGIES (NAACL HLT 2019), VOL. 1, P4171; FAMA EF, 1993, J FINANC ECON, V33, P3, DOI 10.1016/0304-405X(93)90023-5; Frankel R, 2022, MANAGE SCI, V68, P5514, DOI 10.1287/mnsc.2021.4156; García D, 2013, J FINANC, V68, P1267, DOI 10.1111/jofi.12027; Hansen S, 2018, Q J ECON, V133, P801, DOI 10.1093/qje/qjx045; Hoberg G, 2016, J POLIT ECON, V124, P1423, DOI 10.1086/688176; Huang AH, 2023, CONTEMP ACCOUNT RES, V40, P806, DOI 10.1111/1911-3846.12832; Hugging Face, 2023, Hugging face's transformer models; Jegadeesh N, 2013, J FINANC ECON, V110, P712, DOI 10.1016/j.jfineco.2013.08.018; Ke Z, 2020, SSRN Electronic Journal, DOI [10.2139/ssrn.3389884, 10.2139/ssrn.3389884, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.3389884]; Lemmon M., 2014, Rev.

This paper focuses on exploring how to utilize complex networks and sentiment analysis techniques to improve the prediction accuracy of stock movements. We take the semiconductor industry chain stock market as the research object. First, based on complex network theory, we construct a complex network of China’s semiconductor industry chain and extract key network factors. Second, the semantic understanding ability of the large language model is applied to investor comment sentiment analysis, and a multi-dimensional stock sentiment factor is constructed by fine-tuning the GPT large model and combining it with the KNN classifier to recognize investor comment sentiment. Finally, the sentiment factor is combined with the network factors to construct a stock price prediction model using the LSTM algorithm, which is used to predict future stock movements. The experimental results show that the investor sentiment recognition method based on GPT-KNN can obtain an accuracy of 77.59%, which is better than the comparison algorithm, proving the significant advantage of the GPT model in text semantic feature extraction. The average accuracy of the stock trend prediction method integrating multiple factors reaches 69.62%, which is significantly better than the benchmark. Meanwhile, the experimental results of feature combination show that the accuracy is improved by 8.46% and 3.1% by the integration of network factors and sentiment factors, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,"Tan, Y.; Shi, Y.",,,,,,,,,,"9th International Conference on Data Mining and Big Data, DMBD 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105013204500&doi=10.1007%2F978-981-96-7178-6_2&partnerID=40&md5=d0edb5211399176c98f4b2f455bfff17,,,,,,,,,Ho Chi Minh City,,,,,,,,,,Conference paper,,,,18650929; 18650937,,,,,,,57202922715; 60034527500,,Complex Network; Sentiment Analysis; Stock Prediction,,,,,,,,,,27,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Market sentiment, derived from news articles, has been analyzed to understand its influence on stock price movements. A dual dataset approach was employed, consisting of financial news articles from Kompas.com and historical JCI stock data. The research incorporates sentiment analysis using ChatGPT large language models (LLMs), which are then integrated as features into the prediction model. Five scenarios of sentiment integration were evaluated to identify the most effective approach. The results indicate that Scenario 4 consistently delivers the highest prediction accuracy across different evaluation metrics, with Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) values of 0.009555 and 0.007298 in the log metric evaluation, 47.616867 and 36.52605 in the absolute metric evaluation, and 85.146387 and 70.34775 in the stock closing price evaluation. While sentiment integration shows potential, its success is scenario-dependent and influenced by hyperparameter tuning.

The dataset spans January 3, 2014, to August 6, 2024, consisting of 2,647 daily observations enriched with sentiment scores derived from over 10,000 Kompas.com news articles. Sentiment analysis, performed using a Large Language Model (LLM)-based ChatGPT model, classified sentiment into Positive, Neutral, and Negative categories, which were then integrated as predictive features. Five scenarios for incorporating sentiment data were evaluated, with Scenario 2 (sequence of past sentiment scores) yielding the best performance. Specifically, it achieved the lowest Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) across various metrics: 36.4570 and 47.5527 for Absolute Return prediction, 0.005209 and 0.006804 for Relative Return prediction, and 50,725 and 65,653 for Close Price prediction. These findings underscore the significant role of sequential sentiment data in improving prediction accuracy, offering practical recommendations for investors to leverage sentiment analysis in making more informed decisions in the JCI market. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Piscataway, English,,stock prediction;LSTM;sentiment analysis;JCI,11 Mar 2025,,,," Cybernetics , Large language models , PSYCHOLOGY , Sentiment analysis , Root-mean-square errors , Jakarta Indonesia , Indonesia , Environmental","4th International Conference on Intelligent Cybernetics Technology and Applications, ICICyTA 2024",https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-105001662315&doi=10.1109%2FICICYTA64807.2024.10913442&partnerID=40&md5=e6a459e58382284b9b95709dcc56098e,,11 Mar 2025,,,,,,,"Hybrid, Bali",,," School of Computing, Telkom University,Bandung,Indonesia , Universit ' e de Poitiers Intervenant Finance,E'cole Doctorale Science Economics,La Rochelle,France , School of Computing, Telkom University,Bandung,Indonesia , School of Computing, Telkom University,Bandung,Indonesia",,Conference Papers & Proceedings,IEEE,,, English,Conference paper,,,,,,, 2025-03-11,,,,59720391300; 58112005800; 57221096568; 56537112300,,JCI; LSTM; sentiment analysis; stock prediction,979-8-3315-0649-0,,,,,1383.0,,,IEEE Conferences,1388,,,,,,,,, 2024,,,22.0,2024,

Innov.,,,"This study investigates the application of large language models in analyzing sentiment features within the exchange rate markets. Traditional natural language processing methods, such as LDA and BERT, are effective in extracting topics from text; however, they fail to assess the relative importance of these topics in relation to target exchange rates. To bridge this gap, this paper employs ChatGPT to extract topics from texts and evaluate their importance scores, further enhancing exchange rate forecasting by integrating topic importance into the sentiment analysis framework. Through empirical analysis, the superiority of ChatGPT over LDA and BERT in both topic extraction and importance assessment is demonstrated. Furthermore, this study utilizes the topic importance scores generated by ChatGPT to develop a novel interval-valued sentiment index (TIS index). This index not only accounts for the relative importance of various events influencing exchange rate fluctuations but also captures the dynamic evolution of market sentiment within an interval. Empirical results highlight that the TIS Index significantly enhances the forecasting accuracy of interval models such as TARI and IMLP for exchange rates. These findings further demonstrate the advantages of ChatGPT in sentiment analysis within the foreign exchange market. These findings offer new insights into the application of ChatGPT in financial text research. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.",,, Heidelberg, English,yangkun@amss.ac.cn; dengruxin18@mails.ucas.ac.cn;

Learn. Appl.,,,"Financial sentiment analysis plays a crucial role in decoding market trends and guiding strategic trading decisions. Despite the deployment of advanced deep learning techniques and language models to refine sentiment analysis in finance, this study breaks new ground by investigating the potential of large language models, particularly ChatGPT 3.5, in financial sentiment analysis, with a strong emphasis on the foreign exchange market (forex). Employing a zero -shot prompting approach, we examine multiple ChatGPT prompts on a meticulously curated dataset of forex-related news headlines, measuring performance using metrics such as precision, recall, f1 -score, and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of the sentiment class. Additionally, we probe the correlation between predicted sentiment and market returns as an addition evaluation approach. ChatGPT, compared to FinBERT, a well-established sentiment analysis model for financial texts, exhibited approximately 35% enhanced performance in sentiment classification and a 36% higher correlation with market returns. By underlining the significance of prompt engineering, particularly in zero -shot contexts, this study spotlights ChatGPT's potential to substantially boost sentiment analysis in financial applications. By sharing the utilized dataset, our intention is to stimulate further research and advancements in the field of financial services.",,,,,gfatouros@unipi.gr; jsoldat@innov-acts.com; kkouroumali@ote.gr; gmakridis@unipi.gr; dimos@unipi.gr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"RADARWEG 29, 1043 NX AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS",,,,,gold,13.0,,,MACH LEARN APPL,,QO0O4,,,,DEC 15,ChatGPT; Artificial intelligence; Finance; Sentiment analysis; Risk assessment,,,"[Anonymous], 2022, BLOOM 176B PARAMETER, DOI DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.2211.05100; Arner DW, 2015, SSRN Electronic Journal, DOI [10.2139/ssrn.2676553, DOI 10.2139/SSRN.2676553, 10.2139/ssrn.2676553]; Baker M, 2007, J ECON PERSPECT, V21, P129, DOI 10.1257/jep.21.2.129; Bing Liu, 2012, Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Tech-nologies; Blaskowitz O, 2011, INT J FORECASTING, V27, P1058, DOI 10.1016/j.ijforecast.2010.07.002; Bloomberg, 2023, Bloomberg media distribution; Bollen J, 2011, J COMPUT SCI-NETH, V2, P1, DOI 10.1016/j.jocs.2010.12.007; Brock A, 2019, Arxiv, DOI arXiv:1809.11096; Brown TB, 2020, ADV NEUR IN, V33; Chen C., 2018, Textual sentiment, option characteristics, and stock return predictability; Chen HL, 2014, REV FINANC STUD, V27, P1367, DOI 10.1093/rfs/hhu001; Dakhel AM, 2023, J SYST SOFTWARE, V203, DOI 10.1016/j.jss.2023.111734; Devlin J, 2019, Arxiv, DOI [arXiv:1810.04805, DOI 10.48550/ARXIV.1810.04805]; Evans MDD, 2005, J INT MONEY FINANC, V24, P197, DOI 10.1016/j.jimonfin.2004.12.004; Farimani SA, 2022, KNOWL-BASED SYST, V247, DOI 10.1016/j.knosys.2022.108742; Fatouros Georgios, 2023, Zenodo, DOI 10.5281/ZENODO.7976208; Fatouros Georgios, 2023, Digit Finance, V5, P29, DOI [10.1007/s42521-022-00050-0, 10.1007/s42521-022-00050-0]; George AShaji., 2023, Partners Universal Int.
