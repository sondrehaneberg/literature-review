Zhang et al. (2025) investigate financial forecasting from Monetary Policy Conference (MPC) calls by integrating textual, visual, and audio modalities through a multimodal, knowledge-enhanced framework named MANAGER. The model combines external financial knowledge (FinDKG), modality-specific encoders (BEiT-3 for video, HuBERT for audio, and text embeddings), and a knowledge-enhanced graph network with ChatGLM2 serving as the large language model backbone. This architecture enables the model to jointly capture semantic, tonal, and visual cues from MPC meetings while leveraging financial context.
Compared to traditional deep learning baselines such as LSTM, GRU, and multimodal transformers without LLM integration, MANAGER achieves significantly improved performance in both price movement and volatility prediction tasks. Specifically, the model attains the highest F1-scores for directional prediction (≈0.67–0.70) and the lowest Mean Squared Error (≈0.033–0.035) for volatility estimation, outperforming all ablated versions. These results highlight that incorporating an LLM (ChatGLM2) with external knowledge and multimodal reasoning substantially enhances predictive accuracy and interpretability, as the model can also generate coherent textual explanations for its forecasts.";;

The study investigates a prompt-based Large Language Model (LLM) framework designed to analyze candlestick charts, comparing its performance with image-based models such as MobileNetV2, Vision Transformer, and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), as well as numerical models including Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest, LSTM, and CNN-LSTM. While LLMs have shown promising potential in stock price prediction, their direct application to visual data poses challenges compared to traditional numerical methods. To address this, the study employs post-hoc calibration techniques such as Platt Scaling to enhance prediction reliability and mitigate bias. The results demonstrate that calibration significantly improves performance — for instance, the LLaMA model’s accuracy increases from 0.70 to 0.86 after calibration. Overall, the findings indicate that LLMs like LLaMA and Qwen can effectively predict stock price movements using candlestick charts when properly calibrated, making them competitive with established financial forecasting models.";LLaMA-3.2-11B, Qwen-2-7B;Stock

The authors collect 2.5 million news articles from nine major U.S. and international newspapers, classifying each as UP or DOWN depending on whether it implies rising or falling global commodity prices. For 18 commodities, a monthly Commodity News Ratio (CNR) is computed as the net share of positive versus negative news. Using Partial Least Squares (PLS), these ratios are aggregated into a single Commodity News Ratio Index (CNRI) representing the overall market sentiment. Regression analyses show that the ChatGPT-based CNRI significantly predicts 1–12-month excess returns on the commodity index. The benchmark model is the historical average return, and ChatGPT delivers substantial improvements, with an in-sample R2R^2R2 of 23.6% after 2004 and an out-of-sample R2R^2R2 of 5.84%. Finally, ChatGPT outperforms both the traditional Bag-of-Words method and the BERT encoder model, confirming its superior capability in extracting predictive semantic information from financial text.;GPT-3.5;Derivatives

Composite Index (JCI) when combined with historical price data using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)

approaches to embed this information into the time series model. Among these, Scenario 2, which utilizes a
sequence of historical sentiment scores, consistently delivers the most accurate results across several evaluation
metrics, including MAE and RMSE. This outcome suggests that temporal patterns in sentiment provide valuable
predictive information, underscoring the significance of capturing sentiment dynamics rather than relying solely
on single-day values. However, the effect of sentiment integration is not uniform across all forecasting tasks. In
particular, for relative return predictions, the inclusion of sentiment features occasionally reduced performance,
implying that the predictive value of sentiment depends on the target variable and must be adapted to the
modeling context.";GPT-4o-mini;Index

LLM-en brukes som flere spesialiserte “agenter” som samarbeider om å analysere, tolke og foreslå handelsstrategier.
Den er altså ikke trent direkte på aksjedata, men styrer arbeidsflyten, gjenkjenner mønstre, og lager forklarbare beslutninger.

Studien demonstrerer arkitekturen, beskriver arbeidsflyten mellom agentene og viser eksperimenter på historiske data for store amerikanske selskaper (f.eks. Apple, Amazon, Google).

Z. Li et al. (2024) present FAMA (FActor Mining Agent), a new approach that applies Large Language
Models (LLMs) to the task of financial factor discovery. The idea is to let LLMs act as a bridge between
symbolic methods, which are interpretable, and neural approaches, which are efficient but often opaque. FAMA
integrates two complementary mechanisms. The first, Cross-Sample Selection (CSS), ensures that the model
is exposed to a wide set of diverse factor examples, helping it avoid producing similar or repetitive outputs.
The second, Chain-of-Experience (CoE), allows the system to build on previously effective patterns, effectively
“learning from experience” to improve the search for high-quality factors. When tested on real S&P 500 stock
market data, FAMA outperformed earlier models. The method improved RankIC by 0.006 and RankICIR by
0.105 compared to the previous state of the art. In simulated investments, it also achieved an annualized return
of 38.4% and an exceptionally high Sharpe ratio of 667.2, indicating both strong performance and low risk.";GPT-3.5;Stock

De bruker ikke en LLM direkte, men heller ideen bak.

Dette kalles in-context learning – modellen lærer på stedet ut fra konteksteksempler uten å trene på nytt.
Song et al. overfører denne idéen til finans:
• De lager “demonstrasjoner” av markedet — oppsummeringer av hva som nylig har gått opp eller ned.
• Disse demonstrasjonene blir som prompten i en LLM.
• Deretter lager de en egen nettverksarkitektur som endrer vektene sine dynamisk ut fra denne konteksten.
Dermed imiterer de LLM-ens evne til å lære fra kontekst, men med et spesialbygd nettverk for aksjedata.

To alleviate this issue, the recently popularized concept of In-Context learning has provided
us with valuable insights. In this approach, large language models
(LLMs) are exposed to multiple examples of input-label pairs, also
known as demonstrations, as part of the prompt before performing a task on an unseen example. By thoroughly analyzing these
demonstrations, LLMs can uncover potential patterns and effectively adapt to new tasks. Building upon this concept, we propose a
Context-Informed drift-aware method for Stock Prediction (CISP),
which continually adjusts to the latest market styles and offers
more accurate predictions. ";;

Phi-2 is fine-tuned using QLoRA (Quantized Low-Rank Adaptation), while GPT-4 serves as a general model without fine-tuning. Both GPT-4 and Phi-2 with a trained adapter achieve accuracy scores exceeding random guessing (0.540).

findings demonstrate that ChatGPT is able to anticipate negative abnormal returns following severe weather
conditions. The results also indicate that ChatGPT’s forecasts are particularly accurate for large and financially
robust firms—those with strong profitability, low debt levels, and high liquidity—which tend to experience
the sharpest price drops after extreme weather events. This pattern implies that investors often underreact to
weather-related risks, especially in larger corporations. Additionally, ChatGPT’s predictive ability appears to
be most effective in strong macroeconomic environments, including market upswings, periods of low volatility,

It integrates traditional market variables such as price, volatility, and trading volume with sentiment features extracted from financial news. News data are aligned with the subsequent trading hour on the NYSE. Summaries of news articles are generated using various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tools and analyzed with VADER, FinBERT, and GPT-3.5 Turbo, where GPT is applied in a zero-shot setting. The results show that FinBERT achieves higher SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) values than GPT-3.5, likely due to its domain-specific training on financial texts.

ChatGPT is applied as an input-enhancement tool, generating continuous sentiment polarity scores ranging from --1 (negative) to +1 (positive) for each news article. The authors verified the robustness of this approach by testing multiple prompt formulations, finding that ChatGPT produced stable and consistent sentiment values, which supports the validity of the results. Machine learning models---specifically regression models for predicting the magnitude of cumulative abnormal returns (CAR) and classification models for forecasting their direction---were then trained using these sentiment scores. The findings indicate that ChatGPT-derived sentiment significantly improves the models' ability to describe and predict intraday stock movements compared to baseline specifications.;ChatGPT;Stock
