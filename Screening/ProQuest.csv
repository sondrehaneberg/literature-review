The power of ChatGPT in processing text: Evidence from analysis and prediction in the exchange rate markets,"This study investigates the application of large language models in analyzing sentiment features within the exchange rate markets. Traditional natural language processing methods, such as LDA and BERT, are effective in extracting topics from text; however, they fail to assess the relative importance of these topics in relation to target exchange rates. To bridge this gap, this paper employs ChatGPT to extract topics from texts and evaluate their importance scores, further enhancing exchange rate forecasting by integrating topic importance into the sentiment analysis framework. Through empirical analysis, the superiority of ChatGPT over LDA and BERT in both topic extraction and importance assessment is demonstrated. Furthermore, this study utilizes the topic importance scores generated by ChatGPT to develop a novel interval-valued sentiment index (TIS index). This index not only accounts for the relative importance of various events influencing exchange rate fluctuations but also captures the dynamic evolution of market sentiment within an interval. Empirical results highlight that the TIS Index significantly enhances the forecasting accuracy of interval models such as TARI and IMLP for exchange rates. These findings further demonstrate the advantages of ChatGPT in sentiment analysis within the foreign exchange market. These findings offer new insights into the application of ChatGPT in financial text research.",3253199750,,Scholarly Journals," Yunnan University of Finance and Economics, School of Economics, Kunming, China (GRID:grid.464506.5) (ISNI:0000 0000 8789 406X); Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Sciences, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Beijing, China (GRID:grid.9227.e) (ISNI:0000000119573309) , University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Economics and Management, Beijing, China (GRID:grid.410726.6) (ISNI:0000 0004 1797 8419) , Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Sciences, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Beijing, China (GRID:grid.9227.e) (ISNI:0000000119573309); University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Economics and Management, Beijing, China (GRID:grid.410726.6) (ISNI:0000 0004 1797 8419); Chinese Academy of Sciences, Center for Forecasting Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Beijing, China (GRID:grid.9227.e) (ISNI:0000000119573309) , Chinese Academy of Sciences, State Key Laboratory of Mathematical Sciences, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Beijing, China (GRID:grid.9227.e) (ISNI:0000000119573309); University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, School of Economics and Management, Beijing, China (GRID:grid.410726.6) (ISNI:0000 0004 1797 8419); Chinese Academy of Sciences, Center for Forecasting Science, Academy of Mathematics and Systems Science, Beijing, China (GRID:grid.9227.e) (ISNI:0000000119573309)","Yang, Kun;Deng, Ruxin;Wei, Yunjie;Wang, Shouyang",, OpenAI," © The Author(s) 2025.

Wisdom of the crowd signals: Predictive power of social media trading signals for cryptocurrencies,"The emergence of cryptocurrencies and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications brings unique challenges, including high volatility, limited fundamental valuation methods, and significant informational reliance on social media. Consequently, traditional trading algorithms and decision support systems (DSS) often fall short in effectively capturing these dynamics, underscoring the need for tailored solutions. Recent research on sentiment analysis in cryptocurrency trading has provided mixed evidence regarding its predictive power, highlighting limitations in generalizability and reliability due to the inherent noise of social media content. Addressing these limitations, this study explores crowd-based trading signals, explicit buy and sell recommendations shared by users on social media platforms including X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, Stocktwits, and Telegram. We apply an event study methodology to analyze over 28,000 trading signals extracted using natural language processing (NLP) techniques based on large language models (LLMs). Our findings demonstrate that these explicit crowd-based signals significantly predict short-term cryptocurrency price movements, particularly for assets with lower market capitalization and recent negative returns. An out-of-sample trading strategy using these signals achieves superior risk-adjusted returns, outperforming both a standard cryptocurrency index (CCI30) and the S&amp;P 500. Additionally, we uncover the role of automated accounts (signal bots) actively disseminating trading recommendations. This research advances literature by introducing a precise alternative to sentiment analysis, contributing to the understanding of social media as a distributed financial information environment, and raising theoretical considerations about algorithmic agency and trust. Practical implications span investors, social media platforms, and regulators.",3229330841,,Scholarly Journals," University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany (GRID:grid.6190.e) (ISNI:0000 0000 8580 3777) , University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany (GRID:grid.6190.e) (ISNI:0000 0000 8580 3777) , University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany (GRID:grid.6190.e) (ISNI:0000 0000 8580 3777) , University of Cologne, Cologne, Germany (GRID:grid.6190.e) (ISNI:0000 0000 8580 3777)","Haase, Frederic;Celig, Tom;Rath, Oliver;Schoder, Detlef",,," © The Author(s) 2025.

Detecting Bitcoin Sentiment: Leveraging Language Model Applications in Sentiment Analysis for Bitcoin Price Prediction,"As Bitcoin continues to establish itself as a global asset and discussions around relevant regulations become more active, there is an increasing demand for a comprehensive price prediction framework. To address this necessity, this study aims to enhance the accuracy of Bitcoin price predictions by integrating sentiment information with technical indicators, on-chain data, and cryptocurrency price data. Recognizing Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, the proposed framework incorporates sentiment features derived from both lexicon-based methods and large language models. As unsupervised sentiment tools can introduce label noise particularly in domain-specific or ambiguous financial contexts, this study combines the outputs of multiple sentiment models at the feature level to construct a more stable representation. This design improves the robustness of downstream regression performance and distinguishes the framework from previous hybrid models that relied on a single sentiment source without component-wise evaluation. Experimental results using a dataset spanning 2700&#xa0;days showed that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model with a 3-day window achieves the best performance with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.93% and R-squared value of 0.99106. Feature importance analysis further demonstrates sentiment index as the most impactful feature, as excluding it resulted in the largest decline in predictive accuracy. Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated under four major volatility periods, revealing MAPE values ranging from 1.49 to 4.03%, highlighting the framework’s practical capability in rapidly adapting to sudden market shifts. In summary, integrating sentiment information attained from multiple language models significantly enhanced prediction accuracy compared to single source approaches. These findings highlight the framework’s practical value for sentiment-informed investment strategies and risk alerts, with a modular design that enables flexible adaptation and potential integration into automated trading systems.",3241056936,,Scholarly Journals," Seoul National University, Advanced Institute of Convergence Technology, Suwon-si, Korea (GRID:grid.31501.36) (ISNI:0000 0004 0470 5905) , Sungkyunkwan University, Department of Applied Artificial Intelligence/Department of Human-Artificial Intelligence Interaction, Seoul, Korea (GRID:grid.264381.a) (ISNI:0000 0001 2181 989X) , Sungkyunkwan University, Department of Interaction Science/Department of Human-Artificial Intelligence Interaction, Seoul, Korea (GRID:grid.264381.a) (ISNI:0000 0001 2181 989X)","Jung, Hae Sun;Lee, Haein;Kim, Jang Hyun",,," © The Author(s) 2025.

The <i>supply chain capitalism of AI</i>: a call to (re)think algorithmic harms and resistance through environmental lens,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) is woven into a supply chain of capital, commodities and human labour that has been neglected in critical debates. Given the current surge in generative AI – which is estimated to drive up the extraction of natural resources such as minerals, fossil fuels or water – it is vital to investigate its entire production line from a critical infrastructural perspective. Drawing on the supply chain capitalism , a concept coined by Anna L. Tsing in 2009, this paper contributes to critical AI studies by investigating the structure of AI supply chains, taking into account the mining, electronics, digital and e-waste industry. This paper illustrates how the supply chain capitalism of AI is precipitating geographical asymmetries connected to contested struggles in México by focusing on a key element of these chains: data centres. In times of climate emergency, this paper calls to reconsider algorithmic harms and resistance by investigating the entire capitalist production line of the AI industry from critical and environmental lens.",3258102981,,Scholarly Journals," Oxford Internet Institute (University of Oxford), Oxford, UK; UCL Centre for Capitalism Studies, University College London, London, UK","Valdivia, Ana",,," © 2024 The Author(s).

Modeling Asset Price Process: An Approach for Imaging Price Chart with Generative Diffusion Models,"Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have been recently studied to discover data patterns for prediction and forecasting tasks in finance. However, the use of deep generative models in finance remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the potential of deep generative diffusion models to estimate unknown dynamics using multiple simulations based on stock chart images. We first demonstrate a novel pre-processing framework and synthetic image generation using opening, high, low, and closing stock chart images to train neural networks. Without assuming the specific process as the underlying asset price process, we can generate synthetic data without predetermined assumptions of the underlying movements of stock prices by trained generative diffusion models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully replicates well-known asset price processes. With various simulation paths, we can also accurately estimate option pricing on the S &amp;P 500. We conclude that financial simulation with AI can be a novel approach to financial decision-making.",3232240735,,Scholarly Journals," Seoul National University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Seoul, South Korea (GRID:grid.31501.36) (ISNI:0000 0004 0470 5905) , Sungkyunkwan University, Department of Consumer Science, Seoul, South Korea (GRID:grid.264381.a) (ISNI:0000 0001 2181 989X) , Seoul National University, Department of Industrial Engineering, Seoul, South Korea (GRID:grid.31501.36) (ISNI:0000 0004 0470 5905)","Park, Jinseong;Ko, Hyungjin;Lee, Jaewook",,," © The Author(s) 2024.

Can investors learn from patent documents? Evidence from textual analysis,"This paper examines the role of patent texts in the stock market valuation of patents. Utilizing the large language model BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to summarize contextual information within patent texts, I find that patent texts explain 31.5% of the variation in the stock market valuation of patents and provide large incremental explanatory power beyond other structured patent characteristics, firm characteristics, and technological trends. Additionally, patent texts significantly predict the level, volatility, and cumulation speed of future earnings, suggesting they contain genuine information about firms' performance. However, investors do not fully incorporate such information within patent texts into stock prices, as evidenced by the predictive power of patent texts for future stock returns. This underreaction is diminished after the pre‐grant publication of patent applications is mandated. My findings underscore the value of patent texts as a source of information on internally developed intangibles and have implications for academics, practitioners, and regulators.",3228951141,,Scholarly Journals," Rutgers School of Business–Camden, Rutgers University, Camden, New Jersey, USA","Zheng, Yuxiang",,," © 2025.

Enhancing stock timing predictions based on multimodal architecture: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for text quality improvement,"This study aims to enhance stock timing predictions by leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to filter and analyze online investor comment data. Recognizing challenges such as variable comment quality, redundancy, and authenticity issues, we propose a multimodal architecture that integrates filtered comment data with stock price dynamics and technical indicators. Using data from nine Chinese banks, we compare four filtering models and demonstrate that employing GPT-4 significantly improves financial metrics like profit-loss ratio, win rate, and excess return rate. The multimodal architecture outperforms baseline models by effectively preprocessing comment data and combining it with quantitative financial data. While focused on Chinese banks, the approach can be adapted to broader markets by modifying the prompts of large language models.

"Generative AI for Finance: Applications, Case Studies and Challenges","Generative AI (GAI), which has become increasingly popular nowadays, can be considered a brilliant computational machine that can not only assist with simple searching and organising tasks but also possesses the capability to propose new ideas, make decisions on its own and derive better conclusions from complex inputs. Finance comprises various difficult and time‐consuming tasks that require significant human effort and are highly prone to errors, such as creating and managing financial documents and reports. Hence, incorporating GAI to simplify processes and make them hassle‐free will be consequential. Integrating GAI with finance can open new doors of possibility. With its capacity to enhance decision‐making and provide more effective personalised insights, it has the power to optimise financial procedures. In this paper, we address the research gap of the lack of a detailed study exploring the possibilities and advancements of the integration of GAI with finance. We discuss applications that include providing financial consultations to customers, making predictions about the stock market, identifying and addressing fraudulent activities, evaluating risks, and organising unstructured data. We explore real‐world examples of GAI, including Finance generative pre‐trained transformer (GPT), Bloomberg GPT, and so forth. We look closer at how finance professionals work with AI‐integrated systems and tools and how this affects the overall process. We address the challenges presented by comprehensibility, bias, resource demands, and security issues while at the same time emphasising solutions such as GPTs specialised in financial contexts. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive paper dealing with GAI for finance.",3168125878,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences Pilani, Pilani, India , Department of Computer Science and Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences Pilani, Pilani, India , Department of Electrical and Electronics Engineering, Birla Institute of Technology and Sciences Pilani, Pilani, India , School of Computing, Edinburgh Napier University, Edinburgh, UK , Department of Computer Science and Engineering, IIT(ISM) Dhanbad, Dhanbad, India , Department of Computer Science, University of Illinois, Urbana‐Champaign, Champaign, Illinois, USA","Sai, Siva;Arunakar, Keya;Chamola, Vinay;Hussain, Amir;Bisht, Pranav;Kumar, Sanjeev",,," © 2025.

Integrating spotted hyena optimization technique with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting,"Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has developed as an effective tool for time series predicting, revolutionizing the typical methods of prediction. Different classical approaches that depend on existing approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in image‐image‐translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting (SHOAGAI‐TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI‐TSF technique is to accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price prediction. The SHOAGAI‐TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and determines the probabilistic prediction from it. To boost the prediction results of the CGAN approach, the hyperparameter tuning can be performed by the use of the SHOA. The simulation result analysis of the SHOAGAI‐TSF technique takes place on the stock market dataset. The experimental outcomes determine the significant solution of the SHOAGAI‐TSF algorithm with other compared methods in terms of distinct metrics.",3156280338,,Scholarly Journals," Information Technology Department, Faculty of Computing and Information Technology, King Abdulaziz University, Jeddah, Saudi Arabia","Salama, Reda",,," © 2025 John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd.",,,,,10.1111/exsy.13681, Journal Article,, 2024-08-01, Feb 2025,,,0266-4720,2.0, English, English,,, Oxford,Feb 2025,Expert Systems,,2025,,,42,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/integrating-spotted-hyena-optimization-technique/docview/3156280338/se-2?accountid=12870,,,," Artificial Intelligence , Generative Adversarial Network , Spotted Hyena Optimization , Stock Market Prediction , Time Series Forecasting",," 2024-03-25 (Revised) , 2023-12-14 (Received) , 2024-07-05 (Accepted)",,,," FINANCE , Optimization techniques , FINANCE , Optimization , Generative artificial intelligence , Generative adversarial networks , Recurrent neural networks , Algorithms , Computer vision , Machine learning , SUSTAINABILITY , Predictions , SUSTAINABILITY , Forecasting , Time series"," Artificial Intelligence , Generative Adversarial Network , Spotted Hyena Optimization , Stock Market Prediction , Time Series Forecasting",,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Integrating+spotted+hyena+optimization+technique+with+generative+artificial+intelligence+for+time+series+forecasting&amp;title=Expert+Systems&amp;issn=02664720&amp;date=2025-02-01&amp;volume=42&amp;issue=2&amp;spage=&amp;au=Salama%2C+Reda&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Expert+Systems&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1111%2Fexsy.13681,SciTech Premium Collection
Enhancing Hybrid Bike-Sharing Systems Through Long-Term Inventory Management: A Generative-Model-Informed Reinforcement Learning Approach,"Hybrid bike-sharing systems (operating both bikes and ebikes) are emerging worldwide for flexibility and sustainability. Excessive rebalancing, while addressing supply-demand imbalances, causes financial burdens and resource waste. Hence, long-term daily operations (e.g., rebalancing at midnights for upcoming days) have practical economic significance, but they remain underexplored due to difficulties in tracking high within-day and between-day demand variability and the interplay between demand and daily inventory management strategies. Besides, cooperative operation of bikes and ebikes expands solution space, given their inherent demand coupling. This study is the first to explore long-term daily inventory strategies for the hybrid system (ebikes get charged at stations), determining spatial-heterogeneous inventory at midnight to maximize profits. To address the demand variability perception issue, we develop a recurrent-attentive neural process (RANP) model to predict hour-to-hour demand of the upcoming day. The RANP is integrated into a long-term optimization model, referred to as the generative-models-informed Markov decision process (GMI-MDP), where two cooperative intelligent agents determine the bike–ebike allocation based on demand perception and system rewards. A suite of numerical experiments utilizing a real-world dataset from New York is carried out, and various strategies are compared. The proposed method, through online and offline tests, demonstrates superiority over other MDP-based and rule-based methods, achieving a faster solution-seeking process and more stable rewards than MDP with exact upcoming demand. By comparing inventory volatility, we offer insights into managerial operations.",3258711410,,Scholarly Journals," College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China , Polytechnic Institute, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China , Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, Hong Kong, China , Department of Industrial Engineering and Management, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, Shanghai, China , College of Civil Engineering and Architecture, Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China","Shi, Ziyi;Jiang, Zheyuan;Xu, Meng;Zhou, Yaoming;Zhu, Zheng",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

If GenAI-run investment decisions from most firms are heavily coordinated, they could all give a “sell” signal simultaneously, triggering market crashes. Likewise, simultaneous “buy” signals from GenAI-run investment decisions could cause market bubbles with algorithmically inflated prices. In this way, coordinated actions from LLMs introduce systemic risk into the global financial system. Existing risk analysis for GenAI focuses on endogenous risk from model performance. In comparison, exogenous risk from external factors like macroeconomic changes, natural disasters, or sudden regulatory changes, is understudied. This research fills the gap by creating a framework for measuring exogenous (systemic) risk from LLMs acting in the stock trading system. This research develops a concrete, quantitative framework to understand the systemic risk brought by using GenAI in stock investment by measuring the covariance between LLM stock price predictions across three industries (technology, automobiles, and communications) produced by eight large language models developed across the United States, Europe, and China. This paper also identifies potential data-driven technical, cultural, and regulatory mechanisms for governing AI to prevent negative financial and societal consequences.",3254567662,,Scholarly Journals,,"McClellan, Miranda",,," © 2025 by the author.

Temporal Data Analytics Through Reinforced LLM Architectures for Time-Series Pattern Discovery,"Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Computing Technologies &amp; Data Communication (ICCTDC) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 4 Conference End Date: 2025 July 5 Conference Location: HASSAN, India In these modern times, where much data are involved, temporal data analysis has become a significant medium toward meaningful pattern discovery for informed decision-making in many contemporary fields such as finance, healthcare, and environmental science. Traditional methods of time-series pattern discovery often cannot adequately provide insight into complex real-world datasets due to their high dimensionality and volume. This paper introduces an innovative paradigm that relies on the power of reinforcement-enhanced architectures of LLM to further enhance the improvement of temporal data analysis in timeseries pattern discovery. Our approach integrates the knowledge from state-of-the-art LLMs with reinforcement learning to improve the detection and explanation of complex temporal patterns. We have applied our proposed approach to several real datasets, including stock market indices from the S&amp;P 500 and NOAA weather data. These results represent significant gains in the accuracy of pattern recognition and forecasting performance compared to traditional conventional methods of time-series analysis. Our further reinforced LLM architecture offers higher adaptability and scalability, making it suitable for diversified and large-scale temporal data sets. This advances not only the precision of time-series prediction but also provides deeper insights into the underlying temporal dynamics to drive more strategic and proactive decision-making processes. Our finding illustrates how reinforcement-aided LLM architectures may revolutionize temporal data analytics by opening ways to more robust and intelligent pattern-discovery systems in various real-world applications.",3253876109,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Independent Researcher,Sydney,Australia","Korkanti, Sukanth",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Comparative Analysis of Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM and GPT-2 Models,"Conference Title: 2025 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC) Conference Start Date: 2025 March 15 Conference End Date: 2025 March 15 Conference Location: Princeton, NJ, USA Stock price prediction is a challenging task in both financial and academic sectors, as stock prices often behave unpredictably and nonlinearly within complex systems. This research presents a comparative study of two models: LSTM and GPT-2 which are applied to stock price prediction using Apple Inc.’s open-source data from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 2000 to 2024. The LSTM model produces more accurate results and is better at handling long-term dependencies compared to GPT-2. The GPT-2 model from Hugging Face struggles with temporal modeling, generating inconsistent and unpredictable outputs due to its lack of design for time series data. LSTM excels at finding patterns in the complex financial data, making it a more suitable choice for this project. The LSTM model benefits from the data preparation steps that include feature selection, normalization, handling missing values and all factors that can influence its prediction. GPT-2 shows a weakness in capturing the nonlinear time series stock prices. Its reliance on pre-trained language modeling makes it not suitable for modeling stock data without the specialized adaptations. GPT-2’s outputs often differ from the real time stock data because of its lack of temporal awareness which results in unpredictable predictions. This study shows the strengths and limitations of the two models and emphasizes LSTM’s capability in finding and producing consistent stock price predictions. While GPT-2 performs well in broader contexts, this study demonstrates that LSTM is more effective for stock price prediction. This research shows how machine learning systems can improve and help with future directions of stock price predictions. The work presented in this paper by no means provides any guidance for stock purchasing but is an effort to integrate AI and Machine learning techniques to understand the process of stock price prediction that can be improved by incorporating sophisticated techniques.",3248752748,,Conference Papers & Proceedings,,"Hsieh, Joshua;Ko, Vivienne;Prithvi, K;Zaidi, Sohail",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

LLM-Augmented Enhanced Graph Transformer for Stock Movement Prediction,"Conference Title: 2025 IEEE Region 10 Symposium (TENSYMP) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 7 Conference End Date: 2025 July 9 Conference Location: Christchurch, New Zealand Predicting stock price movements remains challenging due to the complex interactions and dynamics of financial markets. Recent deep learning advances, particularly integrating numerical data with linguistic analysis via large language models (LLMs), have shown promise. This study proposes an LLM-Augmented Enhanced Graph Transformer that combines LLM-generated financial analyses, FinBERT semantic embeddings, and a Graph Transformer to predict daily stock movements for 260 selected S&amp;P 500 stocks in 2024. We construct a static stock relationship graph based on the cosine similarity of aggregated textual embeddings, capturing long-term semantic dependencies while integrating numerical indicators. Experimental results show our approach outperforms traditional time-series models (e.g., LSTM, Transformer, Informer) and graph-based methods (e.g., GCN, GAT), demonstrating the effectiveness of multimodal fusion and graph-based attention. We also discuss computational constraints and the limitations of static graphs, highlighting future directions such as dynamic graph modeling and optimized text processing.",3247511670,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Auckland University of Technology,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Auckland,New Zealand , Auckland University of Technology,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Auckland,New Zealand , Auckland University of Technology,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Auckland,New Zealand , Auckland University of Technology,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Auckland,New Zealand , Auckland University of Technology,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Auckland,New Zealand , Auckland University of Technology,Department of Computer and Information Sciences,Auckland,New Zealand","Zhou, Lei;Chen, Yilong;Yu, Jian;Yongchareon, Sira;Ruan, Ji;Zhang, Yuqi",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Hybrid LSTM-Transformer Model for Stock Market Prediction: A Deep Learning Approach,"Conference Title: 2025 IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing (AITest) Conference Start Date: 2025 July 21 Conference End Date: 2025 July 24 Conference Location: Tucson, AZ, USA Stock market prediction is a complex and dynamic task due to the volatile nature of financial markets, influenced by economic, social, and geopolitical factors. Traditional machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown potential but often fall short in capturing both short-term price fluctuations and long-term dependencies. This paper proposes a novel LSTM-Transformer hybrid model that integrates the sequential modeling capabilities of LSTM with the attention-based long-range pattern recognition of Transformers. To enhance predictive performance, we incorporate key technical indicators—Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands—as well as sentiment features derived from FinBERT, a finance-specific large language model.The model is trained on historical stock data spanning 2015 to 2024 and evaluated using an $80 \%-20 \%$ training-testing split. Performance is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Sharpe Ratio to capture both prediction accuracy and risk-adjusted returns. A rolling-window backtesting approach is used to simulate real-world trading behavior across varying market conditions. Our hybrid model outperforms standalone LSTM, GRU, and Transformer baselines, achieving an MSE of 0.0021, RMSE of 0.0467, and a directional accuracy of $76.4 \%$. These findings highlight the value of combining deep learning, financial indicators, and sentiment analysis for robust stock market forecasting.

Stock Price Prediction with Multimodal Data,"Conference Title: 2025 33rd Signal Processing and Communications Applications Conference (SIU) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 25 Conference End Date: 2025 June 28 Conference Location: Sile, Istanbul, Turkiye In today's financial markets, the influence of dynamic factors is becoming increasingly evident, and markets are affected by real-time data from various sources. In this study, a multimodal machine learning approach is adopted by integrating traditional technical analysis metrics, tweets, and news articles with historical price data. Market sentiment and investor psychology are measured through sentiment analysis of textual data using both the FinBERT and ChatGPT-4o models, and the obtained outputs are combined with financial metrics to construct an LSTM-based stock price prediction model. To enhance the model's stability, LSTM models derived from different training sessions are merged using an ensemble learning method, and the two approaches are compared.

Prophetic markets: Multi-modal deep learning redefines stock market predictions,"Conference Title: 2025 11th International Conference on Communication and Signal Processing (ICCSP) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 5 Conference End Date: 2025 June 7 Conference Location: Melmaruvathur, India Stock market prediction is a vital resource for investors and financial experts looking to reduce risk and maximize profits. In this article, we propose a novel multi-modal deep learning-based method to improve predictions of stock market trends. This study uses an integrated framework of state-of-the-art machine learning techniques, deep learning with LLM, and RAG. We use data retrieval techniques, such as web scraping, to download financial reports containing corporate balance sheets. Further, our method includes real-time sentiment analysis in order to understand the investors’ current mentality which can be crucial in determining the market movements. Technical analysis uses deep learning models to interpret important indicators such as RSI, MACD, CCI, and Stochastic oscillators to uncover underlying patterns and correlations in stock trends. Our experiments demonstrate that this integrated strategy performs better than conventional single-dimensional techniques. We are combining data from corporate financial, sentiment analysis, and technical factors as well as active news sentiment analysis to improve the accuracy and reliability of market predictions by demonstrating the performance of a combined set of data sources. This work draws attention to the importance of the multifaceted integration of data by demonstrating RAG benefits for accurate financial data retrieval and multi-modal analysis in the practical applications of stock markets. The results demonstrate how these new approaches can be combined for profit maximization with better decision-making and risk reduction in financial markets.",3246332952,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Amrita School of Computing,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,India , Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Amrita School of Computing,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,India , Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Amrita School of Computing,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,India , Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham,Amrita School of Computing,Department of Computer Science and Engineering,India","Chidambaram, Hritish;Gontu, Jagruthi;Athmakuri, Sarishma;Jayaraman, Swaminathan",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Applications of Novel Deep Learning Algorithms for Analysing of Cryptocurrency,"Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Computing Technologies (ICOCT) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 13 Conference End Date: 2025 June 14 Conference Location: Bengaluru, India With the worldwide spread of cryptocurrencies, data has become richer and more heterogeneous than before and, as a result, poses a new problem related to prediction and decision making. Although there has been recent increase in acceptance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies, the current analytical models appear to have limited correspondence with cryptocurrency markets. This work directly addresses price forecasting, fraud detection, sentiment analysis, and risk management, thus illustrating the applicability of the current technologies. We implement complex and novel deep learning techniques such as long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit, Bidirectional-LSTM to explore the temporal and spatial behavior of data associated with cryptocurrencies. These models enable accurate predictions of price and market trends along with reinforcement strategies to refine trading strategies and generative models to assess the market and project what the future might require. This is used to help investors and traders spot patterns in the buying and selling of various crypto currencies, these models might have far-reaching effects on the economy. We compared the suggested model's output with that of current setups. This works findings reveal that the proposed model is more accurate than the alternatives since its prediction errors are lower.",3246327989,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Aditya Institute of Technology and Management,Dept. of ECE,Tekkali,India , Swarnadhra Institute of Engineering and Technology,Dept. of ECE,Narsapur,India , CSE, Mohan Babu University (Erstwhile Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College (Autonomous),Tirupati,Andhra Pradesh,India , Mohan Babu University Erstwhile Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College (Autonomous),Department of CA,Tirupati,Andhra Pradesh,India , ECE, Mohan Babu University (Erstwhile Sree Vidyanikethan Engineering College (Autonomous),Tirupati,Andhra Pradesh,India","B.

Incorporating related stock and text for stock price movement prediction based on information fusion,"Conference Title: 2025 6th International Conference on Computing, Networks and Internet of Things (CNIOT) Conference Start Date: 2025 May 23 Conference End Date: 2025 May 25 Conference Location: Shanghai, China Investors have long been concerned with the analysis of textual information related to target stocks when making stock investments. We collected and extracted stock news headlines from the Chinese stock market and utilized a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify stocks related to the target stock and the relationships among them. Based on these relationships, we constructed a related stock relationship graph. Considering the dynamic changes in the relationship weights between stocks, we employed Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to build a feature fusion model for integrating the features of related stock news. Factors influencing prediction were considered, including different methods of text concatenation, the identification of related stocks, the relationship modeling between related stocks, and the fusion of related stock features. A comparative analysis of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model, and the Long Short-Term Memory with Attention (LSTM-Attention) model revealed that both the news headlines of the target stock and the related stocks, along with their relationships, impact stock price movement prediction. Conversely, ignoring feature fusion and textual feature extraction can negatively affect prediction accuracy.",3230558078,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Beijing Technology and Business University,School of Computer and Artificial Intelligence,Beijing,China","Li, Zonghui",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

AI Oracle: A Blockchain-Powered Oracle for LLMs and AI Agents,"Conference Title: 2025 Crypto Valley Conference (CVC) Conference Start Date: 2025 June 5 Conference End Date: 2025 June 6 Conference Location: Rotkreuz, Switzerland Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT and similar architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence by enabling machines to understand and generate human-like text. However, these models are inherently statistical predictors rather than real-time reasoning systems, leading to fundamental limitations in accessing up-to-date information and verifying factual accuracy. This issue is particularly critical in high-stakes domains such as cryptocurrency markets, decentralized finance (DeFi), and autonomous AI agents, where real-time, verifiable, and tamper-proof information is essential for decision-making.In this paper, we introduce AI Oracle, a novel framework that integrates blockchain-powered oracles with LLMs and autonomous agents to ensure real-time access to cryptographically verified knowledge. We compare AI Oracle with both standalone LLMs and retrieval-based systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), highlighting significant advantages in factual reliability, adversarial robustness, and interpretability. AI Oracle combines decentralized consensus, immutable storage, and cryptographic attestation to equip AI agents with enhanced resistance to manipulation, hallucination, and misinformation.Beyond architectural improvements, we explore the broader applicability of AI Oracle across domains that require provable correctness and trust—ranging from real-world asset (RWA) tokenization to autonomous agent coordination and decentralized governance. By positioning AI Oracle as a trust-minimized epistemic infrastructure, we propose a new paradigm in AI systems: the fusion of decentralized trust with autonomous reasoning, enabling agents to operate with resilience, transparency, and embedded verifiability across dynamic environments.",3228555862,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," APRO Research,Melbourne,Australia , APRO Research,Singapore,Singapore","Fu, Shange;Xie, Min",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Enhancing stock timing predictions based on multimodal architecture: Leveraging large language models (LLMs) for text quality improvement,"This study aims to enhance stock timing predictions by leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to filter and analyze online investor comment data. Recognizing challenges such as variable comment quality, redundancy, and authenticity issues, we propose a multimodal architecture that integrates filtered comment data with stock price dynamics and technical indicators. Using data from nine Chinese banks, we compare four filtering models and demonstrate that employing GPT-4 significantly improves financial metrics like profit-loss ratio, win rate, and excess return rate. The multimodal architecture outperforms baseline models by effectively preprocessing comment data and combining it with quantitative financial data. While focused on Chinese banks, the approach can be adapted to broader markets by modifying the prompts of large language models. Our findings highlight the potential of LLMs in financial forecasting and provide more reliable decision support for investors.This study aims to enhance stock timing predictions by leveraging large language models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4, to filter and analyze online investor comment data. Recognizing challenges such as variable comment quality, redundancy, and authenticity issues, we propose a multimodal architecture that integrates filtered comment data with stock price dynamics and technical indicators. Using data from nine Chinese banks, we compare four filtering models and demonstrate that employing GPT-4 significantly improves financial metrics like profit-loss ratio, win rate, and excess return rate. The multimodal architecture outperforms baseline models by effectively preprocessing comment data and combining it with quantitative financial data. While focused on Chinese banks, the approach can be adapted to broader markets by modifying the prompts of large language models.

Hybrid Encoding-based Quantum Self Attention for Financial Time Series Analysis,"Conference Title: 2025 IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech, and Signal Processing Workshops (ICASSPW) Conference Start Date: 2025 April 6 Conference End Date: 2025 April 11 Conference Location: Hyderabad, India Self-attention mechanisms, central to Transformer architectures, have become foundational in the development of large language models (LLMs) and various advanced machine learning systems. These mechanisms are pivotal for effectively capturing complex data dependencies and relationships, which is crucial for tasks such as natural language understanding and generation. However, as dimensionality increases, self-attention mechanisms face significant challenges related to computational efficiency and scalability. This paper introduces an encoding-based quantum self-attention mechanism designed to address these issues by embedding classical data into quantum states. This approach facilitates more efficient computation and reduces model complexity. To further enhance performance for real-world applications, particularly in financial time series forecasting, we propose a hybrid model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with quantum self-attention mechanism. Given the constraints of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this hybrid approach represents a plausible solution, leveraging the strengths of both classical and quantum methods and focusing on achieving faster convergence. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach converges significantly quicker than traditional models, showcasing the advantages of integrating quantum techniques with classical machine learning for practical applications.",3212849192,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Wells Fargo,Bengaluru,India , Wells Fargo,Hyderabad,India , Wells Fargo,New York,NY,USA","Lokes, S;Reddy, Suresh;Samuel Yen Chi Chen",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

MambaLLM: Integrating Macro-Index and Micro-Stock Data for Enhanced Stock Price Prediction,"Accurate stock price prediction requires the integration of heterogeneous data streams, yet conventional techniques struggle to simultaneously leverage fine-grained micro-stock features and broader macroeconomic indicators. To address this gap, we propose MambaLLM, a novel framework that fuses macro-index and micro-stock inputs through the synergistic use of state-space models (SSMs) and large language models (LLMs). Our two-branch architecture comprises (i) Micro-Stock Encoder, a Mamba-based temporal encoder for processing granular stock-level data (prices, volumes, and technical indicators), and (ii) Macro-Index Analyzer, an LLM module—employing DeepSeek R1 7B distillation—capable of interpreting market-level index trends (e.g., S&amp;P 500) to produce textual summaries. These summaries are then distilled into compact embeddings via FinBERT. By merging these multi-scale representations through a concatenation mechanism and subsequently refining them with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), MambaLLM dynamically captures both asset-specific price behavior and systemic market fluctuations. Extensive experiments on six major U.S. stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, and META) reveal that MambaLLM delivers up to a 28.50% reduction in RMSE compared with suboptimal models, surpassing traditional recurrent neural networks and MAMBA-based baselines under volatile market conditions. This marked performance gain highlights the framework’s unique ability to merge structured financial time series with semantically rich macroeconomic narratives. Altogether, our findings underscore the scalability and adaptability of MambaLLM, offering a powerful, next-generation tool for financial forecasting and risk management.",3212074180,,Scholarly Journals," School of Computer Science and Software, Zhaoqing University, Zhaoqing 526000, China , School of Computer Science and Engineering, Macau University of Science and Technology, Taipa, Macao, China","Jin, Yan;Huang, Yuling",, Hangzhou DeepSeek Artificial Intelligence Co Ltd," © 2025 by the authors.

Leveraging Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Enhanced Multi-Asset Portfolio Construction,"Conference Title: 2025 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering and Economics (CiFer) Conference Start Date: 2025, March 17 Conference End Date: 2025, March 20 Conference Location: Trondheim, Norway This study assesses the Large Language Models (LLMs) in creating investment portfolios. We implement a few-shot learning technique, followed by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced with comprehensive up-to-date financial data, using Meta's latest LLM, Llama 3.1-8b. In the first phase, We assess the models' efficacy using key financial indicators, including total returns, annualized volatility, riskadjusted performance (Sharpe ratio), potential loss estimates (value-at-risk), and their pre-training knowledge with the S&amp;P 500 Index performance baseline. In the second phase, we enhance the LLM's knowledge base by RAG and the latest historical and statistical metrics (such as earnings per share (EPS), dividends per share (DPS), profit margin, and many more) for each asset from different classes. The study constrains model inputs to specific sets of financial assets, such as equities, exchangetraded funds (ETFs), commodities, cryptocurrencies, and bonds. To evaluate model performance and adaptability, we analyzed across two distinct time frames: (1) within the models' training data cutoff, and (2) from the cutoff date to the present. This approach enables the assessment of model generalization to past and present market conditions. The research quantifies LLMs’ capabilities in financial asset allocation, comparing baseline performance against RAG-augmented strategies. Our results demonstrate that RAG-enhanced LLM significantly outperforms vanilla LLM in portfolio construction across various asset classes. We contemplate that these results could influence AI-driven financial decision-making processes such as automated trading, real-time sentiment analysis, and investment management.",3194764121,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," University of Manitoba,Department of Computer Science,Winnipeg,Canada , University of Manitoba,Department of Computer Science,Winnipeg,Canada","Hajaghaie, Ahmadreza;Thulasiram, Ruppa K",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

A Sentiment-Augmented Machine Learning Approach to Forecasting IHSG Prices Using XGBoost,"Conference Title: 2025 International Conference on Advancement in Data Science, E-learning and Information System (ICADEIS) Conference Start Date: 2025, Feb. 3 Conference End Date: 2025, Feb. 4 Conference Location: Bandung, Indonesia Stocks are a commonly used investment instrument, representing ownership in a company, and offering opportunities for investors to gain profits through the appreciation of stock value as well as dividend distribution. As one of the main financial assets, stocks are also influenced by various external factors, such as economic conditions, government policies, and market sentiment. All of these factors play a crucial role in determining stock price movements. This study integrates sentiment analysis with the XGBoost algorithm to predict IHSG stock prices. By utilizing historical stock data and sentiment derived from financial news, the study evaluates the impact of sentiment data integration on prediction accuracy. Three types of returns (absolute, relative, and logarithmic) and five sentiment scenarios were employed to assess the contribution of sentiment features to the prediction model. The results indicate that sentiment integration consistently improves the predictive performance of the model compared to using historical data alone. Among the tested scenarios, Scenario 2, 4, and 5 demonstrated the best performance, with an RMSE value of 0.009163 and an MAE value of 0.007432, using the logarithmic return type. These findings suggest that incorporating sentiment features into predictive models can enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions and highlight the potential of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Large Language Models (LLMs) in stock market analysis.",3181456200,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," School of Computing Telkom University,Bandung,Indonesia , Ecole Doctorale Science Economics Universite de Poitiers Intervenant Finance,La Rochelle,France , School of Computing Telkom University,CoE HUMIC,Bandung,Indonesia","Muhammad Rizki Wiratama;Narita Aquarini;Gunawan, Putu Harry",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Comparative Investigation of GPT and FinBERT’s Sentiment Analysis Performance in News Across Different Sectors,"GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a groundbreaking generative model that has facilitated substantial progress in natural language processing (NLP). As the GPT-n series has continued to evolve, its applications have garnered considerable attention across various industries, particularly in finance. In contrast, traditional financial research has primarily focused on analyzing structured data such as stock prices. However, recent trends highlight the growing importance of natural language techniques that address unstructured factors like investor sentiment and the impact of news. Positive or negative information about specific companies, industries, or the overall economy found in news or social media can influence investor behavior and market volatility, highlighting the critical need for robust sentiment analysis. In this context, we utilize the state-of-the-art language model GPT and the finance-specific sentiment analysis model FinBERT to perform sentiment and time-series analyses on financial news data, comparing the performance of the two models to demonstrate the potential of GPT. Furthermore, by examining the relationship between sentiment shifts in financial markets and news events, we aim to provide actionable insights for investment decision-making, emphasizing both the performance and interpretability of the models. To enhance the performance of GPT-4o, we employed a systematic approach to prompt design and optimization. This process involved iterative refinement, guided by insights derived from a labeled dataset. This approach emphasized the pivotal importance of prompt design in improving model accuracy, resulting in GPT-4o achieving higher performance than FinBERT. During the experiment phase, sentiment scores were generated from New York Times news data and visualized through time-series graphs for both models. Although both models exhibited similar trends, significant differences arose depending on news content characteristics across categories. According to the results, the performance of GPT-4o, optimized through prompt engineering, outperformed that of FinBERT by up to 10% depending on the sector. These findings emphasize the importance of prompt engineering and demonstrate GPT-4o’s potential to improve sentiment analysis. Furthermore, the categorized news data approach suggests potential applications in predicting the outlook of categorized financial products.",3181456015,,Scholarly Journals,,"Ji-Won, Kang;Sun-Yong, Choi",, OpenAI," © 2025 by the authors.

LLM-Augmented Linear Transformer–CNN for Enhanced Stock Price Prediction,"Accurately predicting stock prices remains a challenging task due to the volatile and complex nature of financial markets. In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a large language model (LLM), a Linear Transformer (LT), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance stock price prediction using solely historical market data. The framework leverages the LLM as a professional financial analyst to perform daily technical analysis. The technical indicators, including moving averages (MAs), relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands (BBs), are calculated directly from historical stock data. These indicators are then analyzed by the LLM, generating descriptive textual summaries. The textual summaries are further transformed into vector representations using FinBERT, a pre-trained financial language model, to enhance the dataset with contextual insights. The FinBERT embeddings are integrated with features from two additional branches: the Linear Transformer branch, which captures long-term dependencies in time-series stock data through a linearized self-attention mechanism, and the CNN branch, which extracts spatial features from visual representations of stock chart data. The combined features from these three modalities are then processed by a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) for final stock price prediction. Experimental results on the S&amp;P 500 dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves stock prediction accuracy by effectively capturing temporal, spatial, and contextual dependencies in the data. This multimodal approach highlights the importance of integrating advanced technical analysis with deep learning architectures for enhanced financial forecasting.",3165832691,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.) , Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.) , Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.) , School of Information Science and Technology, North China University of Technology, Beijing 100144, China; <email>wangguiling@ncut.edu.cn</email> , The School of Computer and Control Engineering, Yantai University, Yantai 254005, China; <email>zhizhongliu@ytu.edu.cn</email> , Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.) , Department of Computer Science, Auckland University of Technology, Auckland 1010, New Zealand; <email>yuqi.zhang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (Y.Z.); <email>jian.yu@aut.ac.nz</email> (J.Y.); <email>sira.yongchareon@aut.ac.nz</email> (S.Y.); <email>nancy.wang@autuni.ac.nz</email> (N.W.)","Zhou, Lei;Zhang, Yuqi;Yu, Jian;Wang, Guiling;Liu, Zhizhong;Yongchareon, Sira;Wang, Nancy",,," © 2025 by the authors.

Let the Laser Beam Connect the Dots: Forecasting and Narrating Stock Market Volatility,"Forecasting market volatility, especially high-volatility incidents, is a critical issue in financial market research and practice. Business news as an important source of market information is often exploited by artificial intelligence–based volatility forecasting models. Computationally, deep learning architectures, such as recurrent neural networks, on extremely long input sequences remain infeasible because of time complexity and memory limitations. Meanwhile, understanding the inner workings of deep neural networks is challenging because of the largely black box nature of large neural networks. In this work, we address the first challenge by proposing a long- and short-term memory retrieval (LASER) architecture with flexible memory and horizon configurations to forecast market volatility. Then, we tackle the interpretability issue by devising a BEAM algorithm that leverages a large pretrained language model (GPT-2). It generates human-readable narratives verbalizing the evidence leading to the model prediction. Experiments on a Wall Street Journal news data set demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed LASER-BEAM pipeline in predicting high-volatility market scenarios and generating high-quality narratives compared with existing methods in the literature.",3141136108,,Scholarly Journals,,"Zhang, Zhu (Drew);Yuan, Jie;Gupta, Amulya",,, Copyright Institute for Operations Research and the Management Sciences Nov/Dec 2024,,,,,10.1287/ijoc.2022.0055, Journal Article,,, Nov/Dec 2024,,,1091-9856,6.0, English, English,,, Linthicum,Nov/Dec 2024,INFORMS Journal on Computing,,2024,,,36,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/let-laser-beam-connect-dots-forecasting-narrating/docview/3141136108/se-2?accountid=12870,,,,,,, 1400,,," Neural networks , SUSTAINABILITY , SUSTAINABILITY , Artificial neural networks , Volatility , SUSTAINABILITY , Recurrent neural networks , Algorithms , Market research , Artificial intelligence , Machine learning , Predictions , Forecasting , Narratives , OPERATIONS , FINANCE",,,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Let+the+Laser+Beam+Connect+the+Dots%3A+Forecasting+and+Narrating+Stock+Market+Volatility&amp;title=INFORMS+Journal+on+Computing&amp;issn=10919856&amp;date=2024-11-01&amp;volume=36&amp;issue=6&amp;spage=1400&amp;au=Zhang%2C+Zhu+%28Drew%29%3BYuan%2C+Jie%3BGupta%2C+Amulya&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=INFORMS+Journal+on+Computing&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1287%2Fijoc.2022.0055,SciTech Premium Collection
Meta graphical lasso: uncovering hidden interactions among latent mechanisms,"In complex systems, it's crucial to uncover latent mechanisms and their context-dependent relationships. This is especially true in medical research, where identifying unknown cancer mechanisms and their impact on phenomena like drug resistance is vital. Directly observing these mechanisms is challenging due to measurement complexities, leading to an approach that infers latent mechanisms from observed variable distributions. Despite machine learning advancements enabling sophisticated generative models, their black-box nature complicates the interpretation of complex latent mechanisms. A promising method for understanding these mechanisms involves estimating latent factors through linear projection, though there's no assurance that inferences made under specific conditions will remain valid across contexts. We propose a novel solution, suggesting data, even from systems appearing complex, can often be explained by sparse dependencies among a few common latent factors, regardless of the situation. This simplification allows for modeling that yields significant insights across diverse fields. We demonstrate this with datasets from finance, where we capture societal trends from stock price movements, and medicine, where we uncover new insights into cancer drug resistance through gene expression analysis.In complex systems, it's crucial to uncover latent mechanisms and their context-dependent relationships.

Multi-factor stock price prediction based on GAN-TrellisNet,"Applying deep learning, especially time series neural networks, to predict stock price, has become one of the important applications in quantitative finance. Recently, some GAN-based stock prediction models are proposed, where LSTM or GRU is used as the generator. However, these generators lack the function of feature extraction, and the prediction accuracies are slightly low. Meanwhile, these models choose some simple volume-price factors (such as OCHLV and OCHLVC) as inputs, without considering the impact of other factors on stock prices. In order to solve these problems, a stock prediction method based on multiple factors and GAN-TrellisNet is proposed. Instead of “OCHLV” or ”OCHLVC,” a multi-factor strategy with ”alpha158+OCHLVC” is introduced to enrich the stock data of inputs. The proposed generative adversarial network (GAN) is a combination of two neural networks which are TrellisNet as generative model and convolutional neural network (CNN) as discriminative model for adversarial training to forecast the stock market. TrellisNet, which integrates the feature extraction capabilities of CNN and the temporal processing capabilities of recurrent neural network (RNN), will generate new predicted results based on historical data, and then CNN will distinguish between predicted results and real stock prices. In order to demonstrate the performance of our method, we selected the decade data of different stocks from four markets (A-shares, U.S. stocks, U.K. stocks and Hong Kong stocks) as dataset and conducted two groups of comparative experiments. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on GAN, our method has better performance in terms of MSE, MAE, RMSE and MAPE. In addition, the multi-factor strategy with “alpha158+OCHLVC” is more effective than the original strategy with OCHLVC factors.",3070855207,,Scholarly Journals," Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, School of Software, Nanjing, China (GRID:grid.260478.f) (ISNI:0000 0000 9249 2313); Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Jiangsu Collaborative Innovation Center of Atmospheric Environment and Equipment Technology (CICAEET), Nanjing, China (GRID:grid.260478.f) (ISNI:0000 0000 9249 2313); Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, Jiangsu Province Engineering Research Center of Advanced Computing and Intelligent Services, Nanjing, China (GRID:grid.260478.f) (ISNI:0000 0000 9249 2313) , Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, School of Software, Nanjing, China (GRID:grid.260478.f) (ISNI:0000 0000 9249 2313) , Nanjing University of Information Science and Technology, School of Software, Nanjing, China (GRID:grid.260478.f) (ISNI:0000 0000 9249 2313)","Liu, Wenjie;Ge, Yebo;Gu, Yuchen",,," © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature 2024.

Emoji driven crypto assets market reactions,"In the burgeoning realm of cryptocurrency, social media platforms like Twitter have become pivotal in influencing market trends and investor sentiments. In our study, we leverage GPT-4 and a fine-tuned transformer-based BERT model for a multimodal sentiment analysis, focusing on the impact of emoji sentiment on cryptocurrency markets. By translating emojis into quantifiable sentiment data, we correlate these insights with key market indicators such as BTC Price and the VCRIX index. Our architecture’s analysis of emoji sentiment demonstrated a distinct advantage over FinBERT’s pure text sentiment analysis in such predicting power. This approach may be fed into the development of trading strategies aimed at utilizing social media elements to identify and forecast market trends. Crucially, our findings suggest that strategies based on emoji sentiment can facilitate the avoidance of significant market downturns and contribute to the stabilization of returns.

Transforming Financial Market Prediction Through Generative AI-Powered Data Management,"Conference Title: 2024 4th International Conference on Innovative Sustainable Computational Technologies (CISCT) Conference Start Date: 2024 Dec. 27 Conference End Date: 2024 Dec. 28 Conference Location: Dehradun, India Predicting financial markets remains essential for decision-making in trading and investment. However, traditional models often fall short due to low-quality data, market volatility, and the complexity of global economic trends. Generative AI offers a transformative approach by improving data management processes, enhancing prediction accuracy, and overcoming the limitations of current forecasting models. This research explores the potential of Generative AI to enrich financial data through techniques like data augmentation, synthetic data generation, and anomaly detection. Specifically, the study investigates how integrating Generative AI into data preprocessing can enhance predictive modeling using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting, particularly in stock prices. The research also explores feature engineering techniques such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and volatility metrics, which are crucial for capturing market trends. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are employed to create additional realistic trading scenarios, boosting model robustness. Implemented using Python, the findings reveal that the combined LSTM and GAN model improved prediction accuracy over traditional methods, achieving an RMSE of 0.096 and R-squared ( $\mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{2}}$ ) $\mathbf{0. 8 5}$ in stock price forecasts. The incorporation of synthetic data with traditional financial metrics leads to an improvement in the model's ability to predict short-term market trends. These findings suggest that the use of Generative AI can provide a more resilient and adaptive approach to financial market prediction, opening new avenues for research in the domain. Future research could focus on expanding the scope to include multi-market scenarios and incorporating real-time data streams.",3247459034,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Co-operative Central Bank Ltd,Adilabad District,Telanagana,India , Narsee Monjee Institute of Management Studies (NMIMS), Deemed to be University,Hyderabad,Telangana,India , Osmania University,Faculty of Management,Hyderabad,India , School of Management, Graphic Era Hill University, Bhimtal,Dehradun,Uttarakhand,India , Panimalar Engineering College,Department of English,Chennai,India","Shivalini, M Satya;Gandra, Praveen Kumar;Suryanarayana Alamuri;Santoshi Sen Gupta;Prema, S",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Sentiment Score of Bloomberg Market Wraps with ChatGPT,"Conference Title: 2024 IEEE International Conference on Data Mining Workshops (ICDMW) Conference Start Date: 2024, Dec. 9 Conference End Date: 2024, Dec. 9 Conference Location: Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates In this paper, we used a large dataset of daily Bloomberg Financial Market Summaries from 2010 to 2023, reposted on large financial media, to determine how global news headlines affect stock market movements. To make this analysis more effective, we employed ChatGPT. First, from the summary of daily financial updates, we identify top global news headlines that could have a significant influence on stock markets. Second, for each headline, we questioned ChatGPT to answer whether the news might lead to a rise, a fall in stock prices or an indecisive future. This two-stage method proves more effective than a direct question on the entire text. By gathering ChatGPT’s predictions day by day, we formed an overall market sentiment score and transform this score into a practical investment strategy in the NASDAQ index, demonstrating the significance of minimizing noise in sentiment scores by initially accumulating and then detrending them. This approach showcases that ChatGPT’s analysis of news headlines can provide valuable insights into future stock market behaviours and be a valuable tool to develop intuitive NLP-driven investment strategies leveraging news predictive power.",3178893372,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," AI for Alpha and CentraleSupelec , AI for Alpha,Paris,France , AI for Alpha,Paris,France , AI for Alpha,Paris,France , AI for Alpha,Paris,France","Lefort, Baptiste;Benhamou, Eric;Ohana, Jean-Jacques;Guez, Beatrice;Saltiel, David",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

LLM-Driven Feature Extraction for Stock Market Prediction: A Case Study of Tehran Stock Exchange,"Conference Title: 2024 15th International Conference on Information and Knowledge Technology (IKT) Conference Start Date: 2024, Dec. 24 Conference End Date: 2024, Dec. 26 Conference Location: Isfahan, Iran, Islamic Republic of Stock market prediction is one of the most challenging research areas in recent years. With the emergence of deep learning and artificial intelligence, researchers have proposed various methods to predict stock market directions, considering different financial variables. One of the most significant variables influencing stock movement is user opinions and social media, which has attracted much attention from researchers in recent years. Although existing studies have introduced various methods to combine stock price and textual features, a reliable and comprehensive method has not yet been established, and there is still room for improvement. In this research, a novel method based on large language models is introduced for feature extraction from financial texts, and a self-attention mechanism is proposed to capture the internal relationships between textual and financial features. The results of the model presented in this study show a 3.10% improvement in accuracy compared to the latest competing models on a newly collected dataset",3171483511,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," University of Tehran,College of Interdisciplinary Science and Technology,Tehran,Iran , University of Tehran,College of Interdisciplinary Science and Technology,Tehran,Iran","Siavash Hosseinpour Saffarian;Haratizadeh, Saman",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Can GPT Price Options?,"Conference Title: 2024 IEEE International Conference on Future Machine Learning and Data Science (FMLDS) Conference Start Date: 2024, Nov. 20 Conference End Date: 2024, Nov. 23 Conference Location: Sydney, Australia Options are financial instruments that grant the holder the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell an underlying asset at a predetermined price within a specified time frame. Traditional option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes equation, depend on simplifying assumptions and struggle to effectively capture complex market dynamics. The study investigates the viability of using the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model to assess the value of stock options. We fine-tune the state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-turbo model by utilizing past option chain data and evaluate its precision in predicting option prices for well-known technology stocks including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT). Our model employs many features, including strike price, underlying price, days to expiry, and volatility index (VIX), to precisely predict option prices. Extensive examination undertaken at various degrees of moneyness and time horizons demonstrates that GPT models consistently surpass Black-Scholes in terms of both mean absolute error and root mean squared error. Out of all the models that were assessed, the 5-year data models exhibit the greatest overall accuracy. An error study suggests that pricing for options at the money has improved, but there are issues in appropriately pricing options that are highly in the money or out of the money. The GPT technique shows promise in leveraging transformers for computational finance applications.",3168457828,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Northeastern University,Khoury College of Computer Sciences,Boston,USA , Northeastern University,Khoury College of Computer Sciences,Seattle,USA","Ashish Anil Pawar;Chaudhary, Divya",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

A Comparative Study of Sequential Deep Learning Models in Financial Time Series Forecasting,"Conference Title: 2024 11th International Conference on Soft Computing &amp; Machine Intelligence (ISCMI) Conference Start Date: 2024, Nov. 22 Conference End Date: 2024, Nov. 23 Conference Location: Melbourne, Australia Time series analysis of daily stock prices is challenging due to the inherent complexity, nonlinearity, and nonstationarity of financial data. In this paper, we compare three sequential deep learning models—LSTM, Transformer, and Large Language Models (LLMs)—for stock price prediction. By transforming the regression problem of predicting daily log returns into a classification task, we evaluate the models’ classification accuracies, with the Transformer achieving the highest accuracy of 22%, followed by LSTM (15.6%) and LLM (15.3%). Regression metrics showed LSTM initially performing better, with a lower RMSE (180.92) than LLM (1739.61). However, outlier predictions in the LLM, caused by incomplete number outputs, inflated its error. After removing these outliers, LLM’s RMSE improved significantly to 33.85, surpassing LSTM. These results demonstrate the potential of Transformer and LLM models for financial time series prediction. Future work will explore incorporating self-reflection mechanisms in LLM predictions and extending the comparison to multivariate financial time series incorporating textual data and other features.",3161366659,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Independent Researcher , University of North Texas , Meta , Taylor University , Hewlett Packard Enterprise , I-66 Express Mobility Partners","Fang, Jingxing;Xiao, Zhaomin;Wu, Yingyi;Zhang, Jinran;Xu, Zhuoer;Zhelu Mai",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Large Language Models for Financial Aid in Financial Time-series Forecasting,"Conference Title: 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData) Conference Start Date: 2024, Dec. 15 Conference End Date: 2024, Dec. 18 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA Considering the difficulty of financial time series forecasting in financial aid, much of the current research focuses on leveraging big data analytics in financial services. One modern approach is to utilize ""predictive analysis"", analogous to forecasting financial trends. However, many of these time series data in Financial Aid (FA) pose unique challenges due to limited historical datasets and high dimensional financial information, which hinder the development of effective predictive models that balance accuracy with efficient runtime and memory usage. Pre-trained foundation models are employed to address these challenging tasks. We use state-of-the-art time series models including pre-trained LLMs (GPT-2 as backbone), transformers, and linear models to demonstrate their ability to outperform traditional approaches, even with minimal (""few-shot"") or no fine-tuning (""zero-shot"").

Combining Financial Data and News Articles for Stock Price Movement Prediction Using Large Language Models,"Conference Title: 2024 IEEE International Conference on Big Data (BigData) Conference Start Date: 2024, Dec. 15 Conference End Date: 2024, Dec. 18 Conference Location: Washington, DC, USA Predicting financial markets and stock price movements requires analyzing a company’s performance, historic price movements, industry-specific events alongside the influence of human factors such as social media and press coverage. We assume that financial reports (such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements), historical price data, and recent news articles can collectively represent aforementioned factors.We combine financial data in tabular format with textual news articles and employ pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict market movements. Recent research in LLMs has demonstrated that they are able to perform both tabular and text classification tasks, making them our primary model to classify the multi-modal data. We utilize retrieval augmentation techniques to retrieve and attach relevant chunks of news articles to financial metrics related to a company and prompt the LLMs in zero, two, and four-shot settings. Our dataset contains news articles collected from different sources, historic stock price, and financial report data for 20 companies with the highest trading volume across different industries in the stock market. We utilized recently released language models for our LLM-based classifier, including GPT- 3 and 4, and LLaMA- 2 and 3 models.We introduce an LLM-based classifier capable of performing classification tasks using combination of tabular (structured) and textual (unstructured) data. By using this model, we predicted the movement of a given stock’s price in our dataset with a weighted F1-score of 58.5% and 59.1% and Matthews Correlation Coefficient of 0.175 for both 3-month and 6-month periods.The dataset and codes for this paper can be found on Github. https://github.com/aliielahi/FinedFMP 1",3156643044,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," University of Illinois Chicago,Department of Computer Science , University of Illinois Chicago,Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering","Elahi, Ali;Taghvaei, Fatemeh",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

To achieve a better accuracy in sentiment classification, experiments are designed to compare six different models (GPT 4, Llama 3, Gemma 2, Mistral 7b, FinBERT, VADER) in financial news sentiment classification, and it was found that recent large language models can outperform FinBERT and VADER, which are the most commonly used models in financial sentiment analysis. Based on the experiment results, Llama 3, with relatively stable performance, is chosen to classify the news sentiments of the selected companies. Informer, Transformer, TCN, LSTM, SVR, Random Forest and Naive Forecast are used to predict the stock prices with different sliding window sizes. Experiments with different scenarios are designed to evaluate the prediction ability of news sentiment. Results show that adding news sentiment data can indeed improve the stock price prediction.

Fin-ALICE: Artificial Linguistic Intelligence Causal Econometrics,"This study introduces Fin-ALICE (Artificial Linguistic Intelligence Causal Econometrics), a framework designed to forecast financial time series by integrating multiple analytical approaches including co-occurrence networks, supply chain analysis, and emotional sentiment analysis to provide a comprehensive understanding of market dynamics. In our co-occurrence analysis, we focus on companies that share the same emotion on the same day, using a much shorter horizon than our previous study of one month. This approach allows us to uncover short-term, emotion-driven correlations that traditional models might overlook. By analyzing these co-occurrence networks, Fin-ALICE identifies hidden connections between companies, sectors, and events. Supply chain analysis within Fin-ALICE will evaluate significant events in commodity-producing countries that impact their ability to supply key resources. This analysis captures the ripple effects of disruptions across industries and regions, offering a more nuanced prediction of market movements. Emotional sentiment analysis, powered by the Fin-Emotion library developed in our prior research, quantifies the emotional undertones in financial news through metrics like “emotion magnitude” and “emotion interaction”. These insights, when integrated with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), significantly enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts by capturing the emotional drivers of market sentiment. Key contributions of Fin-ALICE include its ability to perform month-by-month company correlation analysis, capturing short-term market fluctuations and seasonal patterns. We compare the performance of TCNs against advanced models such as LLMs and LSTMs, demonstrating that the Fin-ALICE model outperforms these models, particularly in sectors where emotional sentiment and supply chain dynamics are critical. Fin-ALICE provides decision-makers with predictive insights and a deeper understanding of the underlying emotional and supply chain factors that drive market behaviors.",3149659379,,Scholarly Journals,,"McCarthy, Shawn;Alaghband, Gita",, Goldman Sachs Group Inc," © 2024 by the authors.

Large Language Models and the Elliott Wave Principle: A Multi-Agent Deep Learning Approach to Big Data Analysis in Financial Markets,"Traditional technical analysis methods face limitations in accurately predicting trends in today’s complex financial markets. Meanwhile, existing AI-driven approaches, while powerful in processing large datasets, often lack interpretability due to their black-box nature. This paper presents ElliottAgents, a multi-agent system that combines the Elliott wave principle with LLMs, showcasing the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and natural language processing (NLP) in financial analysis. By integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the system processes vast amounts of market data to identify Elliott wave patterns and generate actionable insights. The system employs a coordinated team of specialized agents, each responsible for specific aspects of analysis, from pattern recognition to investment strategy formulation. We tested ElliottAgents on both stock and cryptocurrency markets, evaluating its effectiveness in pattern identification and trend prediction across different time scales. Our experimental results demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy when combining classical technical analysis with AI-driven approaches, particularly when enhanced by DRL-based backtesting process. This research contributes to the advancement of financial technology by introducing a scalable, interpretable framework that enhances market analysis capabilities, offering a promising new methodology for both practitioners and researchers.",3149517631,,Scholarly Journals," Institute of Control and Computation Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology, Nowowiejska 15/19, 00-665 Warsaw, Poland; <email>michal.wawer.stud@pw.edu.pl</email> , Institute of Computer Science, Warsaw University of Technology, Nowowiejska 15/19, 00-665 Warsaw, Poland; <email>jaroslaw.chudziak@pw.edu.pl</email> , Institute of Control and Computation Engineering, Warsaw University of Technology, Nowowiejska 15/19, 00-665 Warsaw, Poland; <email>michal.wawer.stud@pw.edu.pl</email>","Wawer, Michał;Chudziak, Jarosław A;Niewiadomska-Szynkiewicz, Ewa",,," © 2024 by the authors.

Semantic Graph Learning for Trend Prediction from Long Financial Documents,"Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Symposium on Computational Intelligence for Financial Engineering and Economics (CIFEr) Conference Start Date: 2024, Oct. 22 Conference End Date: 2024, Oct. 23 Conference Location: Hoboken, NJ, USA The advent of large language models (LLMs) has initiated much research into their various financial applications. However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&amp;P 1500 Composite Index. We find that our AMR-based approach outperforms fine-tuning LLMs directly on text in predicting stock price movement trends at different time horizons in both datasets. Our work also outperforms previous work utilizing document graphs and GNNs for text classification.",3143008588,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Troy,NY,USA , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Troy,NY,USA , Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute,Troy,NY,USA","Xia, Bolun Namir;Gupta, Aparna;Zaki, Mohammed J",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

"Innovative Sentiment Analysis and Prediction of Stock Price Using FinBERT, GPT-4 and Logistic Regression: A Data-Driven Approach","This study explores the comparative performance of cutting-edge AI models, i.e., Finaance Bidirectional Encoder representations from Transsformers (FinBERT), Generatice Pre-trained Transformer GPT-4, and Logistic Regression, for sentiment analysis and stock index prediction using financial news and the NGX All-Share Index data label. By leveraging advanced natural language processing models like GPT-4 and FinBERT, alongside a traditional machine learning model, Logistic Regression, we aim to classify market sentiment, generate sentiment scores, and predict market price movements. This research highlights global AI advancements in stock markets, showcasing how state-of-the-art language models can contribute to understanding complex financial data. The models were assessed using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and ROC AUC. Results indicate that Logistic Regression outperformed the more computationally intensive FinBERT and predefined approach of versatile GPT-4, with an accuracy of 81.83% and a ROC AUC of 89.76%. The GPT-4 predefined approach exhibited a lower accuracy of 54.19% but demonstrated strong potential in handling complex data. FinBERT, while offering more sophisticated analysis, was resource-demanding and yielded a moderate performance. Hyperparameter optimization using Optuna and cross-validation techniques ensured the robustness of the models. This study highlights the strengths and limitations of the practical applications of AI approaches in stock market prediction and presents Logistic Regression as the most efficient model for this task, with FinBERT and GPT-4 representing emerging tools with potential for future exploration and innovation in AI-driven financial analytics.",3132880417,,Scholarly Journals," School of Computing and Digital Technologies, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield S1 2NU, UK<email>o.popoola@shu.ac.uk</email> (O.P.) , School of Computing and Digital Technologies, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield S1 2NU, UK<email>o.popoola@shu.ac.uk</email> (O.P.) , School of Computing and Digital Technologies, Sheffield Hallam University, Sheffield S1 2NU, UK<email>o.popoola@shu.ac.uk</email> (O.P.) , Department of Computing & Mathematics, University of Brighton, Brighton BN2 4GJ, UK; <email>b.ogunleye@brighton.ac.uk</email>","Shobayo, Olamilekan;Adeyemi-Longe, Sidikat;Popoola, Olusogo;Ogunleye, Bayode",,," © 2024 by the authors.

Harnessing Earnings Reports for Stock Predictions: A QLoRA-Enhanced LLM Approach,"Conference Title: 2024 6th International Conference on Data-driven Optimization of Complex Systems (DOCS) Conference Start Date: 2024, Aug. 16 Conference End Date: 2024, Aug. 18 Conference Location: Hangzhou, China Accurate stock market predictions following earnings reports are crucial for investors. Traditional methods, particularly classical machine learning models, struggle with these predictions because they cannot effectively process and interpret extensive textual data contained in earnings reports and often overlook nuances that influence market movements. This paper introduces an advanced approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) instruction fine-tuned with a novel combination of instruction-based techniques and quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) compression. Our methodology integrates ‘base factors‘, such as financial metric growth and earnings transcripts, with ‘external factors‘, including recent market indices performances and analyst grades, to create a rich, supervised dataset. This comprehensive dataset enables our models to achieve superior predictive performance in terms of accuracy, weighted Fl, and Matthews correlation coefficient (M CC), especially evident in the comparison with benchmarks such as GPT-4. We specifically highlight the efficacy of the llama-3-8b-Instruct-4bit model, which showcases significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also discusses the potential of expanding the output capabilities to include a ‘Hold’’’’’ option and extending the prediction horizon, aiming to accommodate various investment styles and time frames. This study not only demonstrates the power of integrating cutting-edge AI with fine-tuned financial data but also paves the way for future research in enhancing AI -driven financial analysis tools.",3115575016,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Columbia University,New York,USA , Central University of Finance and Economics,Beijing,China , New York University,New York,USA , Cornell University,Ithaca,USA , Independent Researcher,Beijing,China , University of Michigan,Ann Arbor,USA , Cornell University,Ithaca,USA , Columbia University,New York,USA , New York University,New York,USA , Rutgers University,New Jersey,USA","Ni, Haowei;Meng, Shuchen;Chen, Xupeng;Zhao, Ziqing;Chen, Andi;Li, Panfeng;Zhang, Shiyao;Yin, Qifu;Wang, Yuanqing;Chan, Yuxi",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

The Development of CanPrompt Strategy in Large Language Models for Cancer Care,"Conference Title: 2024 IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (CIBCB) Conference Start Date: 2024, Aug. 27 Conference End Date: 2024, Aug. 29 Conference Location: Natal, Brazil Background: The recent revolution in Large Language Models (LLMs) is transforming industries, enhancing communication, and reshaping research methodologies. LLMs have found significant applications across various sectors, notably in finance for stock market predictions, and in healthcare, where complex medical data is analyzed for diagnosis at an early stage, improving diagnostic procedures, and personalized treatment planning. In healthcare, where complex medical data is analyzed for diagnosis at an early stage. Despite the immense potential, challenges such as overwhelming Big Data, model hallucinations, and ethical concerns about patient privacy and bias persist. Method: We implemented novel strategies like CanPrompt to mitigate the accuracy and hallucination concerns to ensure responsible deployment. The CanPrompt strategy utilizes prompt engineering combined with few-shot and in-context learning to significantly enhance model accuracy by generating more relevant answers. The models were tested against a specialized dataset from MedQuAD, focusing on cancer, and evaluated using metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore to assess the semantic and syntactic accuracy of generated responses against validated ""Gold Answers"". Through this approach, the study seeks to outline the potential and limitations of LLMs in improving cancer care. Result: After applying CanPrompt with models Mistral 7x8b, Falcon 40b, and Llama 3-8b, BERTScore results showed Mistral leading with an accuracy around 84%, Falcon slightly lower, and Llama the least, with respective precision scores also reflecting a similar trend. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the promise of LLMs in cancer care through the introduction of CanPrompt.",3114548084,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Thompson Rivers University,Faculty of Science,Canada , Thompson Rivers University,MamatjanLab,Canada , Carleton University,School of Information Technology,Canada , Thompson Rivers University,Faculty of Science,Canada","Ahmad, Noman;Mamatjan, Ehsan;Wali, Tursun;Yasin Mamatjan",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Estimating Value at Risk for Central Counterparties: A Generative AI Approach,"Conference Title: 2024 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA) Conference Start Date: 2024, July 10 Conference End Date: 2024, July 11 Conference Location: Kuta, Bali, Indonesia Central counterparties (CCPs) play an important role in the stability of financial markets by helping to mitigate systemic risk. It is important that CCPs have robust risk management tools in order to protect themselves from failing due to a defaulting member. In this paper a new model using a Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN), a type of generative AI model, is proposed to estimate Value at Risk (VaR), a common metric used to compute initial margin for CCPs. Fifteen years of closing prices from the S&amp;P 500 index was used as the dataset. The model was backtested for a period of four years. The results were evaluated using the number of breaches, Kupiec test, excess margin as well as two procyclicality measures: the standard deviation and peak to trough ratio of margin. The results were compared against three widely used models: filtered historical simulation method, historical VaR and parametric VaR. The results from this study showed that VaR computed using the BiGAN model produced 19 breaches on average for the four-year test period. While the experimental results show the proposed model is comparable with other models in terms of accuracy, its standard deviation for margin calls is lower which results in more short-term stability and a lower excess margin compared to the traditional models. The results of this research encourage further research on using BiGAN to estimate VAR.",3101348560,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," University of London,Department of Computing Goldsmith,London,United Kingdom , School of Information Technology, Crown Instittue of Higher Education,Canberra,Australia , University of London,Department of Computing Goldsmith,London,United Kingdom","Munasinghe, Sachini Udeshika;Rafeh, Reza;Rauchas, Sarah",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Meta graphical lasso: uncovering hidden interactions among latent mechanisms,"In complex systems, it’s crucial to uncover latent mechanisms and their context-dependent relationships. This is especially true in medical research, where identifying unknown cancer mechanisms and their impact on phenomena like drug resistance is vital. Directly observing these mechanisms is challenging due to measurement complexities, leading to an approach that infers latent mechanisms from observed variable distributions. Despite machine learning advancements enabling sophisticated generative models, their black-box nature complicates the interpretation of complex latent mechanisms. A promising method for understanding these mechanisms involves estimating latent factors through linear projection, though there’s no assurance that inferences made under specific conditions will remain valid across contexts. We propose a novel solution, suggesting data, even from systems appearing complex, can often be explained by sparse dependencies among a few common latent factors, regardless of the situation. This simplification allows for modeling that yields significant insights across diverse fields. We demonstrate this with datasets from finance, where we capture societal trends from stock price movements, and medicine, where we uncover new insights into cancer drug resistance through gene expression analysis.",3089002088,,Scholarly Journals," Fujitsu Research, Kawasaki, Japan , Kyoto University, Kyoto, Japan (GRID:grid.258799.8) (ISNI:0000 0004 0372 2033) , Tokyo Medical and Dental University, M &D Data Science Center, Tokyo, Japan (GRID:grid.265073.5) (ISNI:0000 0001 1014 9130) , Tokyo Medical and Dental University, M &D Data Science Center, Tokyo, Japan (GRID:grid.265073.5) (ISNI:0000 0001 1014 9130); Sungshin Women’s University, School of Mathematics, Statistics and Data Science, Seoul, Republic of Korea (GRID:grid.264383.8) (ISNI:0000 0001 2175 669X)","Maruhashi, Koji;Kashima, Hisashi;Miyano, Satoru;Park, Heewon",,," © The Author(s) 2024.

Enhancing Zero-Shot Crypto Sentiment With Fine-Tuned Language Model and Prompt Engineering,"Blockchain technology has revolutionized the financial landscape, witnessing widespread adoption of cryptocurrencies due to their decentralized and transparent nature. As sentiments expressed on social media platforms wield substantial influence over cryptocurrency market dynamics, sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial tool for gauging public opinion and predicting market trends. This paper explores fine-tuning techniques for large language models to enhance sentiment analysis performance. Experimental results demonstrate a significant average zero-shot performance gain of 40% on unseen tasks after fine-tuning, highlighting its potential. Additionally, the impact of instruction-based fine-tuning on models of varying scales is examined, revealing that larger models benefit from instruction tuning, achieving the highest average accuracy score of 75.16%. In contrast, smaller-scale models may experience reduced generalization due to complete model capacity utilization. To gain deeper insight into instruction effectiveness, the paper presents experimental investigations under different instruction tuning setups. Results show the model achieves an average accuracy score of 72.38% for short and simple instructions, outperforming long and complex instructions by over 12%. Finally, the paper explores the relationship between fine-tuning corpus size and model performance, identifying an optimal corpus size of 6,000 data points for the highest performance across different models.

An Efficient GAN-Based Multi-classification Approach for Financial Time Series Volatility Trend Prediction,"Deep learning has achieved tremendous success in various applications owing to its robust feature representations of complex high-dimensional nonlinear data. Financial time-series prediction is no exception. Hence, the volatility trend prediction in financial time series (FTS) has been an active topic for several decades. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GAN), which have been studied extensively in image processing and have achieved excellent results, we present the ordinal regression GAN for financial volatility trends (ORGAN-FVT) method for the end-to-end multi-classification task of FTS. An improved generative model based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) is proposed to capture temporal features effectively and mine the data distribution of volatility trends (short, neutral, and long) from given FTS data. Meanwhile, ordinal regression is leveraged for the discriminator to improve the multi-classification performance, making the model more practical. Finally, we empirically compare ORGAN-FVT with several state-of-the-art approaches on three real-world stock datasets: MICROSOFT(MSFT), Tesla(TSLA), and The People’s Insurance Company of China(PAICC).

A Wavelet Based Method for Un-Stationary Complex System,"Conference Title: 2023 9th International Conference on Big Data and Information Analytics (BigDIA) Conference Start Date: 2023, Dec. 15 Conference End Date: 2023, Dec. 17 Conference Location: Haikou, China It is known that stock system is chaotic, nonlinear and un-stationary system. Stock market analysis system including deep learning method and generative models usually utilize historical datasets to get the stock market features to predict the future trend. The nonlinearity of the stock market system have determined that although the features can be acquired by deep learning and generative models, it consume considerable resources including labelled cost and computing. In order to analyze such system, researchers have proposed a novel wavelet based nonlinear model, along with the interpretable feature from nonlinear and unstationary series data. Wavelet based OLS method is able to get the features of nonlinear system in a relative low cost with the acceptable result accuracy decline. What’s more, it will give an interpretability analysis form the model analysis. To sum up, the Comprehensive performance shows that the predictive power of nonlinear wavelet models outperforms than other baseline methods.",2927643431,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Beijing Institute of Computer Technology and Application,Beijing,Country , Beijing Institute of Computer Technology and Application,Beijing,Country , Beijing Institute of Computer Technology and Application,Beijing,Country , Beijing Institute of Computer Technology and Application,Beijing,Country , Beijing Institute of Computer Technology and Application,Beijing,Country","Wang, Youchen;Wang, Rui;Xu, Miao;Zhao, Qinbo;Zou, Huayi",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

"Price, Complexity, and Mathematical Model","The whole world has entered the era of the Vuca. Some traditional methods of problem analysis begin to fail. Complexity science is needed to study and solve problems from the perspective of complex systems. As a complex system full of volatility and uncertainty, price fluctuations have attracted wide attention from researchers. Therefore, through a literature review, this paper analyzes the research on complex theories on price prediction. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The price forecast receives widespread attention year by year, and the number of published articles also shows a rapid rising trend. (2) The hybrid model can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the single model. (3) The complexity of models is increasing. In the future, the more complex methods will be applied to price forecast, including AI technologies such as LLM. (4) Crude-oil prices and stock prices will continue to be the focus of research, with carbon prices, gold prices, Bitcoin, and others becoming new research hotspots. The innovation of this research mainly includes the following three aspects: (1) The whole analysis of all the articles on price prediction using mathematical models in the past 10 years rather than the analysis of a single field such as oil price or stock price. (2) Classify the research methods of price forecasting in different fields, and found the common problems of price forecasting in different fields (including data processing methods and model selection, etc.), which provide references for different researchers to select price forecasting models. (3) Use VOSviewer to analyze the hot words appearing in recent years according to the timeline, find the research trend, and provide references for researchers to choose the future research direction.",2836402370,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Management and Economics, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China; <email>scarlett_fn@126.com</email> (N.F.); <email>mjhtju@aliyun.com</email> (J.M.); <email>xued2018017@126.com</email> (X.D.); Tianjin Agricultural University, No. 22 Jinjing Road, Xiqing District, Tianjin 300392, China , School of Management, Shijiazhuang Tiedao University, Shijiazhuang 050043, China , Department of Management and Economics, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China; <email>scarlett_fn@126.com</email> (N.F.); <email>mjhtju@aliyun.com</email> (J.M.); <email>xued2018017@126.com</email> (X.D.) , Department of Management and Economics, Tianjin University, Tianjin 300072, China; <email>scarlett_fn@126.com</email> (N.F.); <email>mjhtju@aliyun.com</email> (J.M.); <email>xued2018017@126.com</email> (X.D.)","Fu, Na;Geng, Liyan;Ma, Junhai;Ding, Xue",,," © 2023 by the authors.

Evaluation of transformer models for financial targeted sentiment analysis in Spanish,"Nowadays, financial data from social media plays an important role to predict the stock market. However, the exponential growth of financial information and the different polarities of sentiment that other sectors or stakeholders may have on the same information has led to the need for new technologies that automatically collect and classify large volumes of information quickly and easily for each stakeholder. In this scenario, we conduct a targeted sentiment analysis that can automatically extract the main economic target from financial texts and obtain the polarity of a text towards such main economic target, other companies and society in general. To this end, we have compiled a novel corpus of financial tweets and news headlines in Spanish, constituting a valuable resource for the Spanish-focused research community. In addition, we have carried out a performance comparison of different Spanish-specific large language models, with MarIA and BETO achieving the best results. Our best result has an overall performance of 76.04%, 74.16%, and 68.07% in macro F1-score for the sentiment classification towards the main economic target, society, and other companies, respectively, and an accuracy of 69.74% for target detection. We have also evaluated the performance of multi-label classification models in this context and obtained a performance of 71.13%.Nowadays, financial data from social media plays an important role to predict the stock market.

Lead–lag detection and network clustering for multivariate time series with an application to the US equity market,"In multivariate time series systems, it has been observed that certain groups of variables partially lead the evolution of the system, while other variables follow this evolution with a time delay; the result is a lead–lag structure amongst the time series variables. In this paper, we propose a method for the detection of lead–lag clusters of time series in multivariate systems. We demonstrate that the web of pairwise lead–lag relationships between time series can be helpfully construed as a directed network, for which there exist suitable algorithms for the detection of pairs of lead–lag clusters with high pairwise imbalance. Within our framework, we consider a number of choices for the pairwise lead–lag metric and directed network clustering model components. Our framework is validated on both a synthetic generative model for multivariate lead–lag time series systems and daily real-world US equity prices data. We showcase that our method is able to detect statistically significant lead–lag clusters in the US equity market. We study the nature of these clusters in the context of the empirical finance literature on lead–lag relations, and demonstrate how these can be used for the construction of predictive financial signals.",2741133992,,Scholarly Journals," University of Oxford, Department of Statistics, Oxford, UK (GRID:grid.4991.5) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 8948); The Alan Turing Institute, London, UK (GRID:grid.499548.d) (ISNI:0000 0004 5903 3632) , University of Oxford, Department of Statistics, Oxford, UK (GRID:grid.4991.5) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 8948); The Alan Turing Institute, London, UK (GRID:grid.499548.d) (ISNI:0000 0004 5903 3632); University of Oxford, Mathematical Institute, Oxford, UK (GRID:grid.4991.5) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 8948) , University of Oxford, Department of Statistics, Oxford, UK (GRID:grid.4991.5) (ISNI:0000 0004 1936 8948); The Alan Turing Institute, London, UK (GRID:grid.499548.d) (ISNI:0000 0004 5903 3632)","Bennett, Stefanos;Cucuringu, Mihai;Reinert, Gesine",,," © The Author(s) 2022.

A self-regulated generative adversarial network for stock price movement prediction based on the historical price and tweets,"Stock price movement prediction is an important task of the financial prediction field. The current mainstream approaches usually apply financial texts and some corresponding stock price information to predict the stock price movement. However, the current methods usually suffer from two shortcomings: (1) To reduce the stochasticity in the stock price and financial text information, some researchers adopt generative models to better treat the stochasticity while enduring the overfitting problem during training. (2) Although the current state-of-the-art methods based on the generative adversarial network have been proposed to reduce the overfitting, they only concentrate on the overfitting problem of the stock price information and neglect the above problem of financial text information with higher stochasticity. In this paper, we propose a self-regulated generative adversarial network by combining the generative adversarial network and cooperative network for the stock price movement prediction. Furthermore, the proposed model can effectively reduce the stochasticity and overfitting problems simultaneously for the stock price and the financial text information. The experimental results on the currently commonly used stock dataset based on tweets confirm that the proposed method can achieve the novelly state-of-the-art performance compared with some current advances.",2689717553,,Scholarly Journals," Department of Artificial Intelligence, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, PR China , Department of Artificial Intelligence, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, PR China , Department of Artificial Intelligence, Xiamen University, Xiamen, 361005, PR China","Xu, Hongfeng;Cao, Donglin;Li, Shaozi",,," Copyright Elsevier Science Ltd.

Due to the scarcity of stock data, we adopt a GAN-based deep generative model to create synthetic data samples. To deal with the intrinsic low signal-to-noise ratio property of stock price time series, we formulate the return prediction as a supervised learning problem with tabular dataset, where we do feature engineering before training with a TabNet model.

Generative adversarial network (GAN) and enhanced root mean square error (ERMSE): deep learning for stock price movement prediction,"The prediction of stock price movement direction is significant in financial circles and academic. Stock price contains complex, incomplete, and fuzzy information which makes it an extremely difficult task to predict its development trend. Predicting and analysing financial data is a nonlinear, time-dependent problem. With rapid development in machine learning and deep learning, this task can be performed more effectively by a purposely designed network. This paper aims to improve prediction accuracy and minimizing forecasting error loss through deep learning architecture by using Generative Adversarial Networks. It was proposed a generic model consisting of Phase-space Reconstruction (PSR) method for reconstructing price series and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which is a combination of two neural networks which are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as Generative model and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as Discriminative model for adversarial training to forecast the stock market. LSTM will generate new instances based on historical basic indicators information and then CNN will estimate whether the data is predicted by LSTM or is real. It was found that the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has performed well on the enhanced root mean square error to LSTM, as it was 4.35% more accurate in predicting the direction and reduced processing time and RMSE by 78&#xa0;s and 0.029, respectively. This study provides a better result in the accuracy of the stock index. It seems that the proposed system concentrates on minimizing the root mean square error and processing time and improving the direction prediction accuracy, and provides a better result in the accuracy of the stock index.",2631382395,,Scholarly Journals," Charles Sturt University (CSU), School of Computing Mathematics and Engineering, Sydney, Australia (GRID:grid.1037.5) (ISNI:0000 0004 0368 0777) , Charles Sturt University (CSU), School of Computing Mathematics and Engineering, Sydney, Australia (GRID:grid.1037.5) (ISNI:0000 0004 0368 0777); Western Sydney University (WSU), School of Computer Data and Mathematical Sciences, Sydney, Australia (GRID:grid.1029.a) (ISNI:0000 0000 9939 5719); Kent Institute Australia, Sydney, Australia (GRID:grid.1029.a); Asia Pacific International College (APIC), Sydney, Australia (GRID:grid.1029.a) , Charles Sturt University (CSU), School of Computing Mathematics and Engineering, Sydney, Australia (GRID:grid.1037.5) (ISNI:0000 0004 0368 0777); Western Sydney University (WSU), School of Computer Data and Mathematical Sciences, Sydney, Australia (GRID:grid.1029.a) (ISNI:0000 0000 9939 5719); Asia Pacific International College (APIC), Sydney, Australia (GRID:grid.1029.a) , University of Technology, Department of Computer Engineering, Baghdad, Iraq (GRID:grid.444967.c) (ISNI:0000 0004 0618 8761) , University of Kurdistan Hewler, Computer Science and Engineering, Erbil, Iraq (GRID:grid.449828.b) (ISNI:0000 0004 0404 9231) , The University of Da Nang – University of Science and Education, Faculty of Information Technology, Da Nang, Vietnam (GRID:grid.444910.c) (ISNI:0000 0001 0448 6667) , The University of Da Nang – University of Science and Education, Faculty of Information Technology, Da Nang, Vietnam (GRID:grid.444910.c) (ISNI:0000 0001 0448 6667)","Kumar, Ashish;Alsadoon Abeer;Prasad, P W, C;Abdullah, Salma;Rashid, Tarik A;Pham Duong Thu Hang;Nguyen Tran Quoc Vinh",,," © The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature 2021.",,,,,10.1007/s11042-021-11670-w, Journal Article,, 2021-11-27, Jan 2022,,,1380-7501,3.0, English, English,, 3995-4013, Dordrecht,Jan 2022,Multimedia Tools and Applications,,2022,,,81,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/generative-adversarial-network-gan-enhanced-root/docview/2631382395/se-2?accountid=12870,,,," Stock market prediction , Convolutional neural network , Generative adversarial network , Adversarial , Deep learning , Long short-term memory , Phase-space reconstruction , Generative adversarial networks , Deep learning",," 2021-10-07 (Registration) , 2020-09-07 (Received) , 2021-10-07 (Accepted) , 2021-08-13 (Rev-Recd)", 3995,,," Mean square errors , Time dependence , Accuracy , Deep learning , Mean square values , Root-mean-square errors , Artificial neural networks , Neural networks , Generative adversarial networks , Mathematical models , Deep learning , Economic forecasting , Machine learning"," Stock market prediction , Convolutional neural network , Generative adversarial network , Adversarial , Deep learning , Long short-term memory , Phase-space reconstruction , Generative adversarial networks , Deep learning",,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Generative+adversarial+network+%28GAN%29+and+enhanced+root+mean+square+error+%28ERMSE%29%3A+deep+learning+for+stock+price+movement+prediction&amp;title=Multimedia+Tools+and+Applications&amp;issn=13807501&amp;date=2022-01-01&amp;volume=81&amp;issue=3&amp;spage=3995&amp;au=Kumar%2C+Ashish%3BAlsadoon+Abeer%3BPrasad%2C+P+W%2C+C%3BAbdullah%2C+Salma%3BRashid%2C+Tarik+A%3BPham+Duong+Thu+Hang%3BNguyen+Tran+Quoc+Vinh&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Multimedia+Tools+and+Applications&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1007%2Fs11042-021-11670-w,SciTech Premium Collection
Learning Sentimental and Financial Signals With Normalizing Flows for Stock Movement Prediction,"Stockmovement prediction using Tweets (text) and historical price signals (time series) remains a challenging task due to the complex, noisy and dynamic nature of the stock market. The key to improve prediction performance is effectively capturing the complementarity between market sentiment signal from Tweets and time-series signal from the stock price. In this paper, we contribute a new solution StockNF by exploiting a deep generative model technique, Normalizing Flow (NF), to learn more flexible and expressive posterior distributions of latent variables of Tweets and price signals, which can largely ameliorate the bias inference problem in existing methods. We empirically evaluate the NF technique on a public stock movement prediction dataset and show that StockNF outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines.",2623470644,,Scholarly Journals," University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China , University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China , University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China , University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China","Tai, Wenxin;Zhong, Ting;Mo, Yuhua;Zhou, Fan",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Forecasting daily stock trend using multi-filter feature selection and deep learning,"Stock market forecasting has attracted significant attention mainly due to the potential monetary benefits. Predicting these markets is a challenging task due to numerous interrelated factors, and needs a complete and efficient feature selection process to identify the most informative factors. As a time series problem, stock price movements are also dependent on movements on its previous trading days. Feature selection techniques have been widely applied in stock forecasting, but existing approaches usually use a single feature selection technique, which may overlook some important assumptions about the underlying regression function linking the input and output variables. In this study, we combine features selected by multiple feature selection techniques to generate an optimal feature subset and then use a deep generative model to predict future price movements. First, we compute an extended set of forty-four technical indicators from daily stock data of eighty-eight stocks and then compute their importance by independently training logistic regression model, support vector machine and random forests. Based on a prespecified threshold, the lowest ranked features are dropped and the rest are grouped into clusters. The variable importance measure is reused to select the most important feature from each cluster to generate the final subset. The input is then fed to a deep generative model comprising of a market signal extractor and an attention mechanism. The market signal extractor recurrently decodes market movement from the latent variables to deal with stochastic nature of the stock data and the attention mechanism discriminates between predictive dependencies of different temporal auxiliary outputs. The results demonstrate that combining features selected by multiple feature selection approaches and using them as input into a deep generative model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches.",2492315980,,Scholarly Journals," School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361005, China , School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361005, China , School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361005, China , School of Informatics, Xiamen University, Xiamen, Fujian, 361005, China","Haq, Anwar Ul;Zeb, Adnan;Lei, Zhenfeng;Zhang, Defu",,," Copyright Elsevier BV Apr 15, 2021",,,,,10.1016/j.eswa.2020.114444, Journal Article,,," Apr 15, 2021",,,0957-4174,, English, English,,, New York,"Apr 15, 2021",Expert Systems with Applications,,2021,,,168,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/forecasting-daily-stock-trend-using-multi-filter/docview/2492315980/se-2?accountid=12870,,,," Forecasting , Machine learning , Feature selection , Deep learning , Stock market",,, 1,,," Feature selection , Economic forecasting , Support vector machines , Regression models , Deep learning"," Forecasting , Machine learning , Feature selection , Deep learning , Stock market",,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acompscijour&amp;atitle=Forecasting+daily+stock+trend+using+multi-filter+feature+selection+and+deep+learning&amp;title=Expert+Systems+with+Applications&amp;issn=09574174&amp;date=2021-04-15&amp;volume=168&amp;issue=&amp;spage=1&amp;au=Haq%2C+Anwar+Ul%3BZeb%2C+Adnan%3BLei%2C+Zhenfeng%3BZhang%2C+Defu&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Expert+Systems+with+Applications&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1016%2Fj.eswa.2020.114444,SciTech Premium Collection
On the challenges of predicting microscopic dynamics of online conversations,"To what extent can we predict the structure of online conversation trees? We present a generative model to predict the size and evolution of threaded conversations on social media by combining machine learning algorithms. The model is evaluated using datasets that span two topical domains (cryptocurrency and cyber-security) and two platforms (Reddit and Twitter). We show that it is able to predict both macroscopic features of the final trees and near-future microscopic events with moderate accuracy. However, predicting the macroscopic structure of conversations does not guarantee an accurate reconstruction of their microscopic evolution. Our model’s limited performance in long-range predictions highlights the challenges faced by generative models due to the accumulation of errors.",2489438513,,Scholarly Journals," Indiana University, Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, Bloomington, USA (GRID:grid.411377.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0790 959X) , Indiana University, Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, Bloomington, USA (GRID:grid.411377.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0790 959X) , Indiana University, Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, Bloomington, USA (GRID:grid.411377.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0790 959X) , Indiana University, Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, Bloomington, USA (GRID:grid.411377.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0790 959X) , Indiana University, Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, Bloomington, USA (GRID:grid.411377.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0790 959X) , Indiana University, Center for Complex Networks and Systems Research, Bloomington, USA (GRID:grid.411377.7) (ISNI:0000 0001 0790 959X)","Bollenbacher, John;Pacheco Diogo;Pik-Mai, Hui;Yong-Yeol, Ahn;Flammini Alessandro;Menczer Filippo",,," © The Author(s) 2021.

Stock Price Prediction Based on Conditional Flows Scenario Generation,"Conference Title: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control (ICNSC) Conference Start Date: 2021, Dec. 3 Conference End Date: 2021, Dec. 5 Conference Location: Xiamen, China Stock price forecasting is an important issue in the financial field. However, most of the existing studies were focused on the prediction of a single stock, ignoring the correlation among different assets. A possible way to solve the above problem is to provide a set of scenarios which include the future returns of several stocks, instead of a single one. The flow-based model is a kind of deep learning model proposed in recent years, which has powerful data generation abilities. In this paper, we use a flow-based conditional generative model to forecast the stock price scenario. We use real stock market data to verify the proposed method. The simulation results show that the model based on the proposed method can capture the complex dependence of the future stock relationship and provide more accurate and diversified forecasting results.",2627838231,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," Nanjing University,School of Management and Engineering,Nanjing,China , Nanjing University,School of Management and Engineering,Nanjing,China","Wang, Bo;Wang, Xianhe",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Stock Price Prediction Using Sentiment Analysis,"Conference Title: 2021 IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics (SMC) Conference Start Date: 2021, Oct. 17 Conference End Date: 2021, Oct. 20 Conference Location: Melbourne, Australia We investigate the influence of financial news headline sentiment on the predictability of stock prices using Long Term Short Term Memory (LSTM) networks. The investigation is performed on intraday data with specific lag-times between published article headlines and realised stock prices. FinBERT, a natural language processing model which is fine-tuned specifically for financial news is used to perform sentiment analysis on the company related news headlines. Two base models, one with only historical stock price data as inputs and the other with both historical stock price data and sentiment data from the original BERT model is tested. An alternative model with have both historical stock price data and sentiment data from the fine tuned FinBERT model as additional features. A comparison is performed on both the base and alternative models using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as performance metrics. The results suggest that the use of news headline sentiment features from FinBERT significantly improve the predictive performance of LSTM networks in intraday stock price prediction.

A Methodology for Securities and Cryptocurrency Trading Using Exploratory Data Analysis and Artificial Intelligence,"Conference Title: 2021 1st International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Data Analytics (CAIDA) Conference Start Date: 2021, April 6 Conference End Date: 2021, April 7 Conference Location: Riyadh, Saudi Arabia This paper discusses securities and cryptocurrency trading using artificial intelligence (AI) in the sense that it focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on selected technical indicators before proceeding to modelling, and then to develop more practical models by introducing new reward loss function that maximizes the returns during training phase. The results of EDA reveal that the complex patterns within the data can be better captured by discriminative classification models and this was endorsed by performing back-testing on two securities using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as discriminative models against their counterpart Naïve Bayes as a generative model. To enhance the learning process, the new reward loss function is utilized to retrain the ANN with testing on AAPL, IBM, BRENT CRUDE and BTC using auto-trading strategy that serves as the intelligent unit, and the results indicate this loss superiorly outperforms the conventional cross-entropy used in predictive models. The overall results of this work suggest that there should be larger focus on EDA and more practical losses in the research of machine learning modelling for stock market prediction applications.",2525839800,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," King Fahd University of Petroleum & Minerals,Dept. of Systems Engineering,Dhahran,Saudi Arabia","AL-Sunni, Fouad",,," Copyright The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.

Geopolitical risk uncertainty and oil future volatility: Evidence from MIDAS models,"Using a textual analysis based geopolitical risk (GPR) index, this paper exploits the effects of geopolitical risk uncertainty on oil futures price volatility within a mixed data sampling (MIDAS) modeling framework. With a variety of MIDAS specifications, our in-sample estimation results suggest that the short-term (e.g. one-day-ahead) oil realized volatility is positively associated with GPR uncertainty, and our out-of-sample forecasting exercise indicates that the GPR index is useful for improving short-term oil futures volatility prediction. In addition, we find that the categorical GPR index: GPR action related index (GPA), contributes more to the long-term oil volatility forecasting, compared with GPR threat related index (GPT).",2425570877,,Scholarly Journals,,"Dexiang Mei;Ma, Feng;Liao, Yin;Wang, Lu",,, Copyright Elsevier Science Ltd.

Probabilistic Analysis of Market Impact of Analysts’ Recommendation Revisions,"Conference Title: 2020 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence (SSCI) Conference Start Date: 2020, Dec. 1 Conference End Date: 2020, Dec. 4 Conference Location: Canberra, Australia In this paper, we propose to model the short-term impact of recommendation revisions on stock price movements in probabilistic framework. Through the Bayesian models, we can consolidate the information of all analysts’ recommendations on stocks and predict the post-recommendation price drifts of the underlying stocks. In addition, typically there are only a small number of recommendation revisions on specific stocks on each day. It implies that other analysts’ views to a specific stock are unobservable. With the advantage of generative models, missing observations in the data of recommendation revisions can be accommodated easily. Secondly, we perform an empirical investigation of the Hong Kong equity market and find that the impact of recommendation revisions on stock prices is significant in the 1-day horizon, but insignificant in the longer time horizon when taking account of the transaction costs. Also, we propose trading strategies derived from the posterior probability of directions of price drifts based on the Bayesian models. In our experiment, during the out-of-sample period (1 Jan, 2019 to 21 Feb, 2020), the trading strategies gain double-digit profit returns after transaction costs.",2475976218,,Conference Papers & Proceedings," University of Alberta,Dept. of Math. and Stat.

Stock Price Prediction by Deep Neural Generative Model of News Articles,"In this study, we propose a deep neural generative model for predicting daily stock price movements given news articles. Approaches involving conventional technical analysis have been investigated to identify certain patterns in past price movements, which in turn helps to predict future price movements. However, the financial market is highly sensitive to specific events, including corporate buyouts, product releases, and the like. Therefore, recent research has focused on modeling relationships between these events that appear in the news articles and future price movements; however, a very large number of news articles are published daily, each article containing rich information, which results in overfitting to past price movements used for parameter adjustment. Given the above, we propose a model based on a generative model of news articles that includes price movement as a condition, thereby avoiding excessive overfitting thanks to the nature of the generative model. We evaluate our proposed model using historical price movements of Nikkei 225 and Standard &amp; Poor's 500 Stock Index, confirming that our model predicts future price movements better than such conventional classifiers as support vector machines and multilayer perceptrons. Further, our proposed model extracts significant words from news articles that are directly related to future stock price movements.",2022115812,,Scholarly Journals,,"MATSUBARA, Takashi;AKITA, Ryo;UEHARA, Kuniaki",,, Copyright Japan Science and Technology Agency 2018,,,,,10.1587/transinf.2016IIP0016, Journal Article,,, 2018,,,0916-8532,4.0, English, English,, 901-908, Tokyo,2018,IEICE Transactions on Information and Systems,,2018,,,E101D,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/stock-price-prediction-deep-neural-generative/docview/2022115812/se-2?accountid=12870,,,," stock price prediction , news articles , deep learning , generative model",,, 901,,," News , Mathematical models , Support vector machines , Predictions , Multilayer perceptrons , Finished goods , Stock market indexes"," stock price prediction , news articles , deep learning , generative model",,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Acomputerinfo&amp;atitle=Stock+Price+Prediction+by+Deep+Neural+Generative+Model+of+News+Articles&amp;title=IEICE+Transactions+on+Information+and+Systems&amp;issn=09168532&amp;date=2018-01-01&amp;volume=E101D&amp;issue=4&amp;spage=901&amp;au=MATSUBARA%2C+Takashi%3BAKITA%2C+Ryo%3BUEHARA%2C+Kuniaki&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=IEICE+Transactions+on+Information+and+Systems&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/10.1587%2Ftransinf.2016IIP0016,SciTech Premium Collection
Estimating time-changes in noisy Lévy models,"In quantitative finance, we often model asset prices as a noisy Ito semimartingale. As this model is not identifiable, approximating by a time-changed Levy process can be useful for generative modelling. We give a new estimate of the normalised volatility or time change in this model, which obtains minimax convergence rates, and is unaffected by infinite-variation jumps. In the semimartingale model, our estimate remains accurate for the normalised volatility, obtaining convergence rates as good as any previously implied in the literature.",1787036392,,Scholarly Journals,,"Bull, Adam D",,, Copyright Institute of Mathematical Statistics Oct 2014,,,,,, Feature,,, Oct 2014,,,0090-5364,5.0, English, English,,, Hayward,Oct 2014,Annals of Statistics,,2014,,,42,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/estimating-time-changes-noisy-lévy-models/docview/1787036392/se-2?accountid=12870,," 3400 Investment analysis & personal finance , 9130 Experiment/theoretical treatment"," 3400 Investment analysis & personal finance , 9130 Experiment/theoretical treatment"," Estimation , Semimartingale , Mathematical finance"," 3400 Investment analysis & personal finance , 9130 Experiment/theoretical treatment",, 2026," 3400 Investment analysis & personal finance , 9130 Experiment/theoretical treatment",," Probability distribution , SUSTAINABILITY , Estimating techniques , Studies , FINANCE , SUSTAINABILITY , Approximation"," Estimation , Semimartingale , Mathematical finance",,https://bibsys-almaprimo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/openurl/NTNU_UB/NTNU_UB_services_page?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;genre=article&amp;sid=ProQ:ProQ%3Ahightechjournals&amp;atitle=Estimating+time-changes+in+noisy+L%26eacute%3Bvy+models&amp;title=Annals+of+Statistics&amp;issn=00905364&amp;date=2014-10-01&amp;volume=42&amp;issue=5&amp;spage=2026&amp;au=Bull%2C+Adam+D&amp;isbn=&amp;jtitle=Annals+of+Statistics&amp;btitle=&amp;rft_id=info:eric/&amp;rft_id=info:doi/,SciTech Premium Collection
Bayesian Online Learning of the Hazard Rate in Change-Point Problems,"Change-point models are generative models of time-varying data in which the underlying generative parameters undergo discontinuous changes at different points in time known as change points. Change-points often represent important events in the underlying processes, like a change in brain state reflected in EEG data or a change in the value of a company reflected in its stock price. However, change-points can be difficult to identify in noisy data streams. Previous attempts to identify change-points online using Bayesian inference relied on specifying in advance the rate at which they occur, called the hazard rate (h). This approach leads to predictions that can depend strongly on the choice of h and is unable to deal optimally with systems in which h is not constant in time. In this letter, we overcome these limitations by developing a hierarchical extension to earlier models. This approach allows h itself to be inferred from the data, which in turn helps to identify when change-points occur. We show that our approach can effectively identify change-points in both toy and real data sets with complex hazard rates and how it can be used as an ideal-observer model for human and animal behavior when faced with rapidly changing inputs.",754897843, 13537051,Scholarly Journals,,"Wilson, Robert C;Nassar, Matthew R;Gold, Joshua I",,,," Wilson, Robert C",,,,10.1162/NECO_a_00007, Journal Article,,, Sep 2010,,,0899-7667,9.0, English, English,, 2452-2476,,Sep 2010,Neural Computation, CSAPTjournals,2010,,,22,https://www.proquest.com/scholarly-journals/bayesian-online-learning-hazard-rate-change-point/docview/754897843/se-2?accountid=12870," Neural Computation [Neural Comput.].
