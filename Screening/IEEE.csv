One modern approach is to utilize ""predictive analysis"", analogous to forecasting financial trends. However, many of these time series data in Financial Aid (FA) pose unique challenges due to limited historical datasets and high dimensional financial information, which hinder the development of effective predictive models that balance accuracy with efficient runtime and memory usage. Pre-trained foundation models are employed to address these challenging tasks. We use state-of-the-art time series models including pre-trained LLMs (GPT-2 as backbone), transformers, and linear models to demonstrate their ability to outperform traditional approaches, even with minimal (""few-shot"") or no fine-tuning (""zero-shot"").

Estimating Value at Risk for Central Counterparties: A Generative AI Approach,S. Udeshika Munasinghe; R. Rafeh; S. Rauchas,"Department of Computing Goldsmith, University of London, London, United Kingdom; School of Information Technology, Crown Instittue of Higher Education, Canberra, Australia; Department of Computing Goldsmith, University of London, London, United Kingdom",2024 International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications (ICoDSA),5 Sep 2024,2024,,,305,310,"Central counterparties (CCPs) play an important role in the stability of financial markets by helping to mitigate systemic risk. It is important that CCPs have robust risk management tools in order to protect themselves from failing due to a defaulting member. In this paper a new model using a Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN), a type of generative AI model, is proposed to estimate Value at Risk (VaR), a common metric used to compute initial margin for CCPs. Fifteen years of closing prices from the S&P 500 index was used as the dataset. The model was backtested for a period of four years. The results were evaluated using the number of breaches, Kupiec test, excess margin as well as two procyclicality measures: the standard deviation and peak to trough ratio of margin. The results were compared against three widely used models: filtered historical simulation method, historical VaR and parametric VaR. The results from this study showed that VaR computed using the BiGAN model produced 19 breaches on average for the four-year test period. While the experimental results show the proposed model is comparable with other models in terms of accuracy, its standard deviation for margin calls is lower which results in more short-term stability and a lower excess margin compared to the traditional models. The results of this research encourage further research on using BiGAN to estimate VAR.",,979-8-3503-6535-1,10.1109/ICoDSA62899.2024.10652178,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10652178,Value-at-Risk;Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks;Financial Risk Management;Central Counterparty;Generative AI,Reactive power;Generative AI;Computational modeling;Stability criteria;Estimation;Predictive models;Generative adversarial networks,,1.0,,16.0,IEEE,5 Sep 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

In this paper, we compare three sequential deep learning models—LSTM, Transformer, and Large Language Models (LLMs)—for stock price prediction. By transforming the regression problem of predicting daily log returns into a classification task, we evaluate the models’ classification accuracies, with the Transformer achieving the highest accuracy of 22%, followed by LSTM (15.6%) and LLM (15.3%). Regression metrics showed LSTM initially performing better, with a lower RMSE (180.92) than LLM (1739.61). However, outlier predictions in the LLM, caused by incomplete number outputs, inflated its error. After removing these outliers, LLM’s RMSE improved significantly to 33.85, surpassing LSTM.

Essential concerns in financial works include stock price forecasting and price movement forecast. The stock market research has shown encouraging outcomes in the past. We still don't have a consensus on the finest stock value forecasting classical due to the fact that each study report has different architecture and uses different stock issuers. This paper presents a new method for optimizing bacterial foraging that uses optimal deep learning to forecast stock market trends. For the prediction process, the given model employs a multiplicative long short term memory (MLSTM) perfect, with IBFO serving as the model's fine-tuner. The research paper presents a modified whale optimization technique for feature selection. This research proposes an elitist whale optimization algorithm with the nonlinear parameter (EWOANP) to fix the issue where the whale optimization procedure does not strike a balance among exploration and exploitation and instead falls into the local optimum. To improve the odds of evading the local optimum, the shrinking encircling mechanism employs an elitist tactic based on random Cauchy mutation. Using the random Cauchy mutation as a starting point, the method cleverly selects the population with the best mutation solutions to move on to the next iteration. To strike a compromise among the two, the logarithmic spiral mechanism makes use of a nonlinear parameter.

Comparative Analysis of Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM and GPT-2 Models,J. Hsieh; V. Ko; P. K; S. Zaidi,NA; NA; NA; NA,2025 IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC),8 Sep 2025,2025,,,1,6,"Stock price prediction is a challenging task in both financial and academic sectors, as stock prices often behave unpredictably and nonlinearly within complex systems. This research presents a comparative study of two models: LSTM and GPT-2 which are applied to stock price prediction using Apple Inc.’s open-source data from Yahoo Finance, covering the period from 2000 to 2024. The LSTM model produces more accurate results and is better at handling long-term dependencies compared to GPT-2. The GPT-2 model from Hugging Face struggles with temporal modeling, generating inconsistent and unpredictable outputs due to its lack of design for time series data. LSTM excels at finding patterns in the complex financial data, making it a more suitable choice for this project. The LSTM model benefits from the data preparation steps that include feature selection, normalization, handling missing values and all factors that can influence its prediction. GPT-2 shows a weakness in capturing the nonlinear time series stock prices. Its reliance on pre-trained language modeling makes it not suitable for modeling stock data without the specialized adaptations. GPT-2’s outputs often differ from the real time stock data because of its lack of temporal awareness which results in unpredictable predictions. This study shows the strengths and limitations of the two models and emphasizes LSTM’s capability in finding and producing consistent stock price predictions. While GPT-2 performs well in broader contexts, this study demonstrates that LSTM is more effective for stock price prediction. This research shows how machine learning systems can improve and help with future directions of stock price predictions.

However, the instability of financial markets means it is difficult to maintain a market advantage by relying on a single strategy over the long term. In this paper, we draw on the principles of reinforcement learning to propose a dynamic strategy switching method based on large language models, to adapt to market changes. This method dynamically selects the most suitable strategy for execution based on the current financial market data status and predefined multiple quantitative strategies. Evaluation on two real datasets shows that our method outperforms single-strategy models in several aspects. Furthermore, the application of multi-strategy dynamic switching, combining large language models and reinforcement learning, not only demonstrates superiority but also reveals its great development potential.",2832-3734,979-8-3503-7355-4,10.1109/ICCCBDA61447.2024.10569928,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10569928,Large Language Model;Multi-Strategy;Quantitative Trading;Reinforcement Learning,Industries;Cloud computing;Computational modeling;Switches;Reinforcement learning;Market research;Data models,,3.0,,22.0,IEEE,28 Jun 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

Generative AI offers a transformative approach by improving data management processes, enhancing prediction accuracy, and overcoming the limitations of current forecasting models. This research explores the potential of Generative AI to enrich financial data through techniques like data augmentation, synthetic data generation, and anomaly detection. Specifically, the study investigates how integrating Generative AI into data preprocessing can enhance predictive modeling using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting, particularly in stock prices. The research also explores feature engineering techniques such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and volatility metrics, which are crucial for capturing market trends.

The implementation of the five-minute settlement (5MS) process in the Australian National Electricity Market (NEM) on October 1, 2021, reduced the settlement interval from 30 minutes to 5 minutes. This change has led to more frequent adjustments in pricing, allowing for a more accurate reflection of real-time supply and demand conditions. However, this increased frequency has significantly heightened the complexity of price fluctuations in the wholesale market. Consequently, conventional machine learning and deep learning methods struggle to provide accurate predictions at this higher resolution. Since electricity prices are fundamentally determined by the supply-demand balance and the bidding behaviors of market participants, this work introduces individual participant's bidding behaviors into the prediction model. We fine-tune a pre-trained Large Language Model (LLM) to create bidding behavior agents, which forecasts day-ahead bidding behaviors. Moreover, market sentiment plays a significant role in electricity price volatility, yet it remains challenging to quantify and assess its impact. To address this, we employ a pre-trained LLM to analyze online resources, incorporating market sentiment into the price prediction model. Additionally, to enhance the accuracy of spike predictions, we improve the conditional time series generative adversarial network (CTSGAN) model by utilizing a spike confusion matrix and further strengthen the model by integrating bidding behavior and market sentiment as inputs.

These complexities, combined with the volatility of economies and the limitations of available data, make accurate modeling difficult. Sentiment analysis of economic news offers a novel approach to this challenge by providing instantaneous insights into public mood and market trends, capturing psychological and behavioral aspects that traditional models may miss. This method can enhance understanding of consumer confidence, investment trends, and stock market performance, for instance. In this study, we developed a dictionary and transformer-based sentiment model applied to over two decades of Hungarian economic news. To improve the model’s accuracy, we utilized large language models (LLMs) with active learning to efficiently augment the manually labeled sentiment dataset. We then compared the resulting sentiment-based time series with macroeconomic indicators such as GDP (Gross Domestic Product), PMI (Purchasing Managers’ Index), and unemployment rate. Our results show that integrating LLMs significantly enhances the accuracy of the sentiment models, and the sentiment-based indicators can serve as effective nowcasting tools for the inspected macroeconomic indicators.",2169-3536,,10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3488363,"collaboration between the Central Bank of Hungary and Budapest University of Technology and Economics, through the Central Bank of Hungary and European Union Project within the framework of the Artificial Intelligence National Laboratory(grant numbers:RRF-2.3.1-21-2022-00004); Ministry of Culture and Innovation of Hungary from the National Research, Development and Innovation(grant numbers:TKP2021-NVA); funding scheme(grant numbers:TKP2021-NVA); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10738800,GDP;large language model (LLM);macroeconomic indicator;natural language processing (NLP);PMI;sentiment analysis;unemployment rate,Biological system modeling;Macroeconomics;Economics;Transformers;Analytical models;Data models;Sentiment analysis;Predictive models;Market research;Encoding,,3.0,,36.0,CCBY,30 Oct 2024,,,IEEE,IEEE Journals

Fairness Testing Through Extreme Value Theory,V. Monjezi; A. Trivedi; V. Kreinovich; S.

Since this class of software learns its logic from historical data, it can encode or amplify discriminatory practices. Previous research on algorithmic fairness has focused on improving “average-case” fairness. On the other hand, fairness at the extreme ends of the spectrum, which often signifies lasting and impactful shifts in societal attitudes, has received significantly less emphasis. Leveraging the statistics of extreme value theory (EVT), we propose a novel fairness criterion called extreme counterfactual discrimination (ECD). This criterion estimates the worst-case amounts of disadvantage in outcomes for individuals solely based on their memberships in a protected group. Utilizing tools from search-based software engineering and generative AI, we present a randomized algorithm that samples a statistically significant set of points from the tail of ML outcome distributions even if the input dataset lacks a sufficient number of relevant samples. We conducted several experiments on four ML models (deep neural networks, logistic regression, and random forests) over 10 socially relevant tasks from the literature on algorithmic fairness. First, we evaluate the generative AI methods and find that they generate sufficient samples to infer valid EVT distribution in 95% of cases. Remarkably, we found that the prevalent bias mitigators reduce the average-case discrimination but increase the worst-case discrimination significantly in 35% of cases. We also observed that even the tail-aware mitigation algorithm-MiniMax-Fairness-increased the worst-case discrimination in 30% of cases. We propose a novel ECD-based mitigator that improves fairness in the tail in 90% of cases with no degradation of the average-case discrimination. We hope that the EVT framework serves as a robust tool for evaluating fairness in both average-case and worst-case discrimination.",1558-1225,979-8-3315-0569-1,10.1109/ICSE55347.2025.00070,"NSF(grant numbers:CCF-2317206,CCF-2317207); ",https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=11029970,software testing;fairness;extreme value theory,Hands;Logistic regression;Generative AI;Prevention and mitigation;Software algorithms;Software;Logic;Random forests;Software engineering;Testing,,2.0,,74.0,IEEE,23 Jun 2025,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

It's because many traditional risk assessment models, while good at what they do, are often ill equipped to accurately source upon and analyze the types of dynamic, expansive and unstructured data sets that are commonplace in a modern enterprise. In this brief article we introduce a emerging application of AI–driven risk assessment models that builds on the Transformer architectures (e.g., BERT, GPT and their domain-specific adaptations) to overcome such challenges. Initially created for Natural Language Processing, these powerful models have now achieved state-of-the-art performance across a remarkably broad range of disciplines through previously unimaginable levels of contextual understanding, data synthesis and pattern recognition across multiple data-types. This paradigm shift can be attributed to handicap self-attention mechanisms followed by transformers — architectures in a position to grip through so a lot of info successfully with this self-attention mechanism. This aids in traversing the secondary sources (such as structured data and unstructured databases) of the end-user or legal reviews, which chronicles the risk characteristics in enterprise management. It shows how Transformers can be tuned to industry-specific nuances, and to signal risk — in the context to compliance, financial performance, cybersecurity and operational disruptions. They allow proactive risk management by identifying and managing potential risks before they materialize, employing real-time data streams and historical data analysis to develop predictive insights and recommendations for decision-makers. On the other hand, adding Transformers to existing risk assessment procedures provides wider scalability and adaptability in enterprise management systems. Traditional models take many time iterations to be generalized whereas Transformer models use transfer learning and pre-trained architectures, both of which allow them to scale in industries and be implemented relatively quickly as a result of pre-established architectures. (They can, in the case of financial services, for example, be used to detect credit risks by analyzing histories of borrowers and macroeconomic trends, etc.) In supply chain management for example, they identify vulnerabilities by integrating information about suppliers, market conditions and geopolitical elements. Besides, Transformer-based features-based AI integrated risk assessment models improve human-machine collaboration. The systems also offer human oversight, particularly due to the transparency of the reasoning behind the model outputs and the potential for confidence scores that allow condensation of the data — all essential attributes to ensure that major decision-makers in society are both transparent and accountable. It is particularly crucial in regulated industries, where auditability must be by law and ethics.",,979-8-3315-2749-5,10.1109/IC363308.2025.10957017,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10957017,AI-driven;risk assessment;Transformer architecture;enterprise management;natural language processing;predictive insights;real-time data;financial performance;supply chain vulnerabilities;operational disruptions,Adaptation models;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Predictive models;Transformers;Data models;Real-time systems;Natural language processing;Risk management;Artificial intelligence,,1.0,,50.0,IEEE,16 Apr 2025,,,IEEE,IEEE Conferences

However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain.

Through the Bayesian models, we can consolidate the information of all analysts' recommendations on stocks and predict the post-recommendation price drifts of the underlying stocks. In addition, typically there are only a small number of recommendation revisions on specific stocks on each day. It implies that other analysts' views to a specific stock are unobservable. With the advantage of generative models, missing observations in the data of recommendation revisions can be accommodated easily. Secondly, we perform an empirical investigation of the Hong Kong equity market and find that the impact of recommendation revisions on stock prices is significant in the 1-day horizon, but insignificant in the longer time horizon when taking account of the transaction costs. Also, we propose trading strategies derived from the posterior probability of directions of price drifts based on the Bayesian models.

Traditional forecasting methods, including statistical models and deep learning approaches, often struggle to adapt to rapid market fluctuations and unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many existing models require large datasets and fail to generalize well across different financial conditions. Addressing these challenges, generative models have gained attention for their ability to generate synthetic financial data and improve prediction accuracy. Here, we propose a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) as the generator and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the discriminator to enhance stock price forecasting robustness. Our model is trained using historical stock prices, trading volume, and technical indicators from four major U.S. companies—Apple, Amazon, Google, and Intel—over a period from 2014 to 2023. The dataset is split into pre-and post-COVID-19 periods to assess the model's adaptability to market anomalies. Experimental results indicate that the proposed WGAN-based model achieves an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.31, outperforming conventional methods such as Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Moreover, the model demonstrates minimal performance degradation when exposed to volatile periods, proving its robustness in handling market uncertainties. These findings suggest that WGAN with GRU and CNN is an effective approach to mitigating the impact of market volatility on stock price prediction.

Excessive rebalancing, while addressing supply-demand imbalances, causes financial burdens and resource waste. Hence, long-term daily operations (e.g., rebalancing at midnights for upcoming days) have practical economic significance, but they remain underexplored due to difficulties in tracking high within-day and between-day demand variability and the interplay between demand and daily inventory management strategies. Besides, cooperative operation of bikes and ebikes expands solution space, given their inherent demand coupling. This study is the first to explore long-term daily inventory strategies for the hybrid system (ebikes get charged at stations), determining spatial-heterogeneous inventory at midnight to maximize profits. To address the demand variability perception issue, we develop a recurrent-attentive neural process (RANP) model to predict hour-to-hour demand of the upcoming day. The RANP is integrated into a long-term optimization model, referred to as the generative-models-informed Markov decision process (GMI-MDP), where two cooperative intelligent agents determine the bike–ebike allocation based on demand perception and system rewards. A suite of numerical experiments utilizing a real-world dataset from New York is carried out, and various strategies are compared.

Change-points often represent important events in the underlying processes, like a change in brain state reflected in EEG data or a change in the value of a company reflected in its stock price. However, change-points can be difficult to identify in noisy data streams. Previous attempts to identify change-points online using Bayesian inference relied on specifying in advance the rate at which they occur, called the hazard rate (h). This approach leads to predictions that can depend strongly on the choice of h and is unable to deal optimally with systems in which h is not constant in time.

This approach allows h itself to be inferred from the data, which in turn helps to identify when change-points occur.

We found, however, that there is still great room for improvement in how to fully consider the impact of financial news and stock trends on PM while avoiding model instability caused by feature disparity and fragile convergence due to RL itself. Addressing this allows us to develop more profitable and robust PM strategies. To this end, we propose TrendTrader, a novel RL framework for news-oriented stock portfolio management with trend heuristics.

Additionally, the analysis based on AI/ML Accelerators indicate that changes in architectures using an older semiconductor technology node have comparable energy efficiency with a different architecture using a newer technology. Further comparisons of the energy in computing systems with the thermodynamic and biological limits, indicate that there is a 27–36 orders of magnitude higher energy requirements for total simulation of an application.

These disruptions exacerbate risks, including supply chain breakdowns, operational inefficiencies, and systemic weaknesses, with energy challenges emerging as a key concern due to their effects on production costs, inflation, and sustainability goals. Advanced technologies, such as blockchain, digital twins, generative artificial intelligence (AI), and quantum computing, offer transformative potential to enhance transparency, predictive accuracy, and decision-making agility.

As sentiments expressed on social media platforms wield substantial influence over cryptocurrency market dynamics, sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial tool for gauging public opinion and predicting market trends. This paper explores fine-tuning techniques for large language models to enhance sentiment analysis performance. Experimental results demonstrate a significant average zero-shot performance gain of 40% on unseen tasks after fine-tuning, highlighting its potential. Additionally, the impact of instruction-based fine-tuning on models of varying scales is examined, revealing that larger models benefit from instruction tuning, achieving the highest average accuracy score of 75.16%. In contrast, smaller-scale models may experience reduced generalization due to complete model capacity utilization. To gain deeper insight into instruction effectiveness, the paper presents experimental investigations under different instruction tuning setups. Results show the model achieves an average accuracy score of 72.38% for short and simple instructions, outperforming long and complex instructions by over 12%.

Common examples of graphs are railroads, the Internet, and neural networks. It is both theoretically and practically important to estimate the intensity of direct connections between variables. In this study, a problem of estimating the intrinsic graph structure from observed data is considered. The observed data in this study are a matrix with elements representing dependency between nodes in the graph. The dependency represents more than direct connections because it includes influences of various paths. For example, each element of the observed matrix represents a co-occurrence of events at two nodes or a correlation of variables corresponding to two nodes. In this setting, spurious correlations make the estimation of direct connection difficult. To alleviate this difficulty, a digraph Laplacian is used for characterizing a graph. A generative model of this observed matrix is proposed, and a parameter estimation algorithm for the model is also introduced. The notable advantage of the proposed method is its ability to deal with directed graphs, while conventional graph structure estimation methods such as covariance selections are applicable only to undirected graphs.

Although many efforts have been made, centralized platforms are still vulnerable to underlying security issues, such as an untrusted central server and single-point failure. Fortunately, blockchain has emerged as an alternative infrastructure for building crowdsourcing platforms. Many excellent designs of blockchain-based decentralized crowdsourcing (BDCS) solutions have been proposed. Benefiting from blockchain, BDCS can provide fascinating features, like tampering resistance and anonymity. However, a new attack surface appears in BDCS. Recently, a new attack against BDCS named solution probing attack has been identified. The solution-probing adversary can take advantage of the anonymity of BDCS to probe valid solutions using a generative model. Due to the transparency of blockchain transactions, the probing attack is effective even if solutions are encrypted. Nevertheless, we find transaction-mixing techniques effective in defending against probing attacks. In this article, we introduce the solution probing attack and an improved variant, which can attack coin mixing-based BDCS. We evaluate probing attacks on large-scale crowdsourcing tasks.

Although previous studies have primarily focused on the technical aspects of client-assisted model training, the incentive mechanisms for this scenario remain largely unexplored. Insights from P2P networks suggest that a well-designed incentive mechanism is both catalytic and indispensable for the widespread adoption of client-assisted model training. In this paper, we explore the incentive design problem of client-assisted model training and envision a novel hierarchical procurement auction that captures some properties of client-assisted model training, such as asynchronous client arrivals, synchronous training processes, and complex resource requirements. We formulate the incentive design problem as a social cost minimization problem with $l_{\infty}$-norm constraints and transform it into an approximation problem with an $l_{2}$-norm objective function which facilitates the design of an efficient approximation algorithm.
