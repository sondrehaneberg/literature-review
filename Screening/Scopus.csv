We developed a hybrid approach combining Volume Features, Valuation Metrics, Technical Indicators, and Market Sentiment for stock price prediction and investigate several state-of-the-art models, including Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Bidirectional GRU (BI-GRU), and Transformer-based Time Series (TST) models, while experimenting with different lags of inputs to capture intricate temporal patterns in stock price movements. Our experiments, conducted on seven stocks from various sectors, allow us to evaluate the robustness and generalizability of the models across different industries. To enhance interpretability, we employ large language models (LLMs) in the post-prediction phase, which transform the predictive outputs into human-readable narratives explaining the factors driving stock price predictions. Empirical results demonstrate that our approach, incorporating advanced deep learning models like ANN, GRU, BI-GRU, and TST with varying input lags, significantly improves prediction accuracy over traditional methods while providing actionable insights for financial decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models (LLM); Multivariate Analysis; Stock Price Prediction; Time Series Forecasting; Univariate Data","Decision making; Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Neural networks; Prediction models; Time series; Time series analysis; Historical data; Hybrid approach; Language model; Large language model; Multi variate analysis; Neural-networks; Stock price prediction; Time series forecasting; Univariate; Univariate data; Multivariant analysis","","","","Proceedings of the International Conference on Emerging Trends in Engineering and Technology Icetet, (2020); J Finan Markets Algo, (2022); IEEE Access, (2020); J Finan Data Sci, (2023); Int J Finan Res, (2020); Finan Technol Rev, (2020); International Journal of Computer Science Engineering and Applications, (2014); Sherstinsky, Alex S., Fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 404, (2020); Proceedings of the 30th International Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems Neurips 2022, (2022); Dudukcu, Hatice Vildan, Temporal Convolutional Networks with RNN approach for chaotic time series prediction, Applied Soft Computing, 133, (2023)","Hui, L.; Hsu, C.-H.; Ruengittinun, S.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","13th International Conference on Ubi-Media Computing, Ubi-Media 2025 and 17th International Symposium on Pervasive Systems, Algorithms, and Networks, I-SPAN 2025","","Bangkok","335729","18650929; 18650937","9789819671779; 9783031949425; 9783032042873; 9783031940019; 9783032008831; 9783031951268; 9783031949555; 9783031937088; 9783031951299; 9783031936302","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011987910"

Building on the input encoding mechanism of the LLMTime framework, we extend its application by defining new financial risk measures and performing an empirical evaluation of three generations of GPT models, GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and GPT-4o, versus advanced benchmark models such as GARCH with Student innovations and EWMA with Dynamic Conditional Score (DCS). Financial time series are encoded as numerical strings, allowing for model-free inference without requiring retraining. Results show that LLMs perform well when short rolling windows are used, particularly in volatile markets like cryptocurrencies. GPT-3.5 frequently outperforms or matches the performance of newer models, raising questions about model complexity, alignment, and biases. In contrast, performance deteriorates with longer windows, where the econometric models prove more reliable. Our findings demonstrate the potential of general-purpose LLMs as adaptive tools for short-horizon financial risk assessment and contribute a first-of-its-kind benchmark for LLM-based VaR/ES estimation. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Expected shortfall; GPT; Large language models; LLM-ES; LLM-VaR; Value at risk","Benchmarking; Computational linguistics; Finance; Financial data processing; Risk perception; Statistical methods; Value engineering; Expected shortfall; GPT; Language model; Large language model; Large language model-expected shortfall; Large language model-value at risk; Value at Risk; Risk assessment","","","Funding text 1: This paper is supported through the European Cooperation in Science & Technology COST Action under Grant No. CA19130 - Fintech and Artificial Intelligence in Finance - Towards a transparent financial industry; the project \u201CIDA Institute of Digital Assets\u201D, CF166/15.11.2022, CN760046/23.05.2023; the project \u201CAI for Energy Finance (AI4EFin)\u201D, CF162/15.11.2022, CN760048/23.05.2023, financed under the Romania's National Recovery and Resilience Plan, Apel nr.

Traditional natural language processing methods, such as LDA and BERT, are effective in extracting topics from text; however, they fail to assess the relative importance of these topics in relation to target exchange rates. To bridge this gap, this paper employs ChatGPT to extract topics from texts and evaluate their importance scores, further enhancing exchange rate forecasting by integrating topic importance into the sentiment analysis framework. Through empirical analysis, the superiority of ChatGPT over LDA and BERT in both topic extraction and importance assessment is demonstrated. Furthermore, this study utilizes the topic importance scores generated by ChatGPT to develop a novel interval-valued sentiment index (TIS index). This index not only accounts for the relative importance of various events influencing exchange rate fluctuations but also captures the dynamic evolution of market sentiment within an interval. Empirical results highlight that the TIS Index significantly enhances the forecasting accuracy of interval models such as TARI and IMLP for exchange rates. These findings further demonstrate the advantages of ChatGPT in sentiment analysis within the foreign exchange market.

Consequently, traditional trading algorithms and decision support systems (DSS) often fall short in effectively capturing these dynamics, underscoring the need for tailored solutions. Recent research on sentiment analysis in cryptocurrency trading has provided mixed evidence regarding its predictive power, highlighting limitations in generalizability and reliability due to the inherent noise of social media content. Addressing these limitations, this study explores crowd-based trading signals, explicit buy and sell recommendations shared by users on social media platforms including X (formerly Twitter), Reddit, Stocktwits, and Telegram. We apply an event study methodology to analyze over 28,000 trading signals extracted using natural language processing (NLP) techniques based on large language models (LLMs). Our findings demonstrate that these explicit crowd-based signals significantly predict short-term cryptocurrency price movements, particularly for assets with lower market capitalization and recent negative returns. An out-of-sample trading strategy using these signals achieves superior risk-adjusted returns, outperforming both a standard cryptocurrency index (CCI30) and the S&P 500. Additionally, we uncover the role of automated accounts (signal bots) actively disseminating trading recommendations. This research advances literature by introducing a precise alternative to sentiment analysis, contributing to the understanding of social media as a distributed financial information environment, and raising theoretical considerations about algorithmic agency and trust.

The model trained solely on synthetic data estimates gait parameters with comparable or superior performance compared with real-data-trained models specialized for specific populations and sensor settings. Pre-training on synthetic data with self-supervised learning consistently enhances model performance and data efficiency in adapting to multiple gait-based downstream tasks.

Sentiment analysis of financial news articles is a crucial aspect of this intersection, providing cues about market sentiment that may affect stock price dynamics. Traditional sentiment analysis methods often rely on rules or machine learning algorithms trained on labeled datasets, but these methods face challenges in capturing the context within the text. This paper proposes a framework that incorporates prompt engineering strategies, including a novel Domain Knowledge Chain-of-Thought (DK-CoT) strategy, integrating domain-specific financial knowledge with chain-of-thought reasoning, designed to leverage and enhance the performance of large language models (LLMs) in financial news sentiment analysis. DK-CoT has been compared with various prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, few-shot, and chain-of-thought, as well as other benchmark models like BERT and RoBERTa. Through comprehensive experiments and evaluations, we introduce the weighted F1 score as a more practical metric, emphasizing the disproportionate impact of negative news on financial markets, which better reflects real-world financial dynamics, as negative sentiments often lead to more significant market reactions than positive or neutral sentiments. Experimental results have shown that DK-CoT adopted in an LLM called GLM is effective in improving the performance and reliability of financial news sentiment analysis. Our findings provide insights into optimal prompt designs and highlight the importance of incorporating financial knowledge to uplift LLM performance while reducing the need for extensive computational resources and fine-tuning. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Accessible machine learning; Financial news; Large language model; Natural language processing; Prompt engineering; Sentiment analysis","","","","This research was supported by the Fujian Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant No. 2022J05291).","Cui, Jingfeng, Survey on sentiment analysis: evolution of research methods and topics, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, 8, pp. 8469-8510, (2023); Chen, Weisi, Deep Learning for Financial Time Series Prediction: A State-of-the-Art Review of Standalone and Hybrid Models, CMES - Computer Modeling in Engineering and Sciences, 139, 1, pp. 187-224, (2023); Chatglm A Family of Large Language Models from Glm 130b to Glm 4 all Tools, (2024); Chen, Weisi, A Framework for Facilitating Reproducible News Sentiment Impact Analysis, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 125-131, (2022); Yazdani, Sepideh Foroozan, Sentiment classification of financial news using statistical features, International Journal of Pattern Recognition and Artificial Intelligence, 31, 3, (2017); Ahmad, Hero O., Sentiment Analysis of Financial Textual data Using Machine Learning and Deep Learning Models, Informatica (Slovenia), 47, 5, pp. 153-158, (2023); Das, Nabanita, Integrating EEMD and ensemble CNN with X (Twitter) sentiment for enhanced stock price predictions, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 14, 1, (2024); Li, Wei, User reviews: Sentiment analysis using lexicon integrated two-channel CNN–LSTM​ family models, Applied Soft Computing, 94, (2020); Sharaff, Aakanksha, LSTM based Sentiment Analysis of Financial News, SN Computer Science, 4, 5, (2023); Lengkeek, Matteo, Leveraging hierarchical language models for aspect-based sentiment analysis on financial data, Information Processing and Management, 60, 5, (2023)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","29482992","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105005003252"

Models that encode the time series data to interact with a frozen LLM backbone have been shown to outperform transformers on all benchmark datasets. However, their efficiency on complex datasets, which do not show clear seasonality or trend, remains an open question. In this work, we seek to evaluate the performance of reprogrammed LLMs on the Bitcoin price chart, a financial time series known for its complexity and high volatility. We propose effective methods to improve the performance of Time-LLM, a State-of-the-art (SOTA) method, on such a time series. First, we propose structural improvements to Time-LLM. Second, we suggest an efficient way to handle the non-stationarity of the dataset. Finally, we propose an efficient method for passing additional financial information to the LLM. Our results demonstrate a 50 % improvement on the average percentage loss and a 5 % increase on accuracy of our adapted Time-LLM architecture on Bitcoin data when compared to SOTA models, including the original Time-LLM model.

To address this necessity, this study aims to enhance the accuracy of Bitcoin price predictions by integrating sentiment information with technical indicators, on-chain data, and cryptocurrency price data. Recognizing Bitcoin’s sensitivity to market sentiment, the proposed framework incorporates sentiment features derived from both lexicon-based methods and large language models. As unsupervised sentiment tools can introduce label noise particularly in domain-specific or ambiguous financial contexts, this study combines the outputs of multiple sentiment models at the feature level to construct a more stable representation. This design improves the robustness of downstream regression performance and distinguishes the framework from previous hybrid models that relied on a single sentiment source without component-wise evaluation. Experimental results using a dataset spanning 2700 days showed that the long short-term memory (LSTM) model with a 3-day window achieves the best performance with mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.93% and R-squared value of 0.99106. Feature importance analysis further demonstrates sentiment index as the most impactful feature, as excluding it resulted in the largest decline in predictive accuracy. Additionally, the model's performance was evaluated under four major volatility periods, revealing MAPE values ranging from 1.49 to 4.03%, highlighting the framework’s practical capability in rapidly adapting to sudden market shifts. In summary, integrating sentiment information attained from multiple language models significantly enhanced prediction accuracy compared to single source approaches. These findings highlight the framework’s practical value for sentiment-informed investment strategies and risk alerts, with a modular design that enables flexible adaptation and potential integration into automated trading systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin; Large language models; Price prediction; Sentiment analysis; Time series analysis","Computational linguistics; Costs; Forecasting; Investments; Sentiment analysis; Language model; Large language model; Model application; Percentage error; Performance; Price prediction; Sentiment features; Technical indicator; Time-series analysis; Bitcoin; Time series analysis","","","This research was supported by the SungKyunKwan University and the BK21 FOUR(Graduate School Innovation) funded by the Ministry of Education(MOE, Korea) and National Research Foundation of Korea(NRF).

Conventional methods are often rigid and do not effectively capture cryptocurrency networks’ intricate temporal and structural patterns, while existing dynamic approaches struggle with incomplete or missing information. To tackle this issue, we present MGGPT, a new hybrid framework that integrates Graph Attention Neural Networks (GAT) with GPT-based transformers to improve fraud detection within cryptocurrency transaction networks. Our approach utilizes temporal graph structures through reachability networks (reach-nets) to derive essential node features, while also directly integrating edge labels into the embedding vectors, and introduces an innovative mechanism for predicting missing information to address the challenges posed by incomplete data in blockchain networks. The model features a dual-perspective learning strategy, employing local graph structures via GAT Networks and global contextual patterns through GPT-based sequence modeling to capture both structural and temporal dynamics in transaction networks. Our MGGPT framework implements a sophisticated edge classification mechanism using Support Vector Machines (SVM) for the final prediction. Experimental findings on actual cryptocurrency transaction datasets indicate superior efficacy in identifying fraudulent patterns, achieving notable improvements of 8.5% AUC, a 10.2% increase in Precision, 29.5% increment in recall, and 20.5% improvement in F1-score. Compared to baseline models such as STA-GT and CTGN, the proposed MGGPT improves the representation of dynamic relationships and faster convergence. Overall, the analysis reveals that our framework is not only more accurate but also more robust and scalable for real-world temporal graph applications. Ultimately, we assessed the robustness of our framework against adversarial attacks to show its practical applications in blockchains. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency fraud detection; GPT-2 transformers; Graph neural networks; Missing information prediction; Temporal graph analysis","Blockchain; Crime; Graph neural networks; Graph structures; Graphic methods; Learning systems; Network security; Support vector machines; Cryptocurrency fraud detection; Fraud detection; GPT-2 transformer; Graph analysis; Missing information; Missing information prediction; Temporal graph analyze; Temporal graphs; Cryptocurrency","","","Funding text 1: Qi Xia received her B.Sc., M.Sc., and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science from the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC) in 2002, 2006, and 2010, respectively.

If GenAI-run investment decisions from most firms are heavily coordinated, they could all give a “sell” signal simultaneously, triggering market crashes. Likewise, simultaneous “buy” signals from GenAI-run investment decisions could cause market bubbles with algorithmically inflated prices. In this way, coordinated actions from LLMs introduce systemic risk into the global financial system. Existing risk analysis for GenAI focuses on endogenous risk from model performance. In comparison, exogenous risk from external factors like macroeconomic changes, natural disasters, or sudden regulatory changes, is understudied. This research fills the gap by creating a framework for measuring exogenous (systemic) risk from LLMs acting in the stock trading system. This research develops a concrete, quantitative framework to understand the systemic risk brought by using GenAI in stock investment by measuring the covariance between LLM stock price predictions across three industries (technology, automobiles, and communications) produced by eight large language models developed across the United States, Europe, and China.

Using data from 40 countries over 1995–2022, we construct three factors: geopolitical risk factor (GPRF), geopolitical act factor (GPAF), and geopolitical threat factor (GPTF). This study documents four main findings. First, geopolitical threats (GPTs) have markedly stronger GRE than geopolitical acts (GPAs), with 58% of countries showing significant GPTF results vs. 35% for GPAF. Second, predictability is strongest at shorter horizons, with 68% of countries demonstrating significant one-month predictability for GPTF effects. Third, these effects persist even after accounting for established market risk factors, with 33% of countries maintaining significant GPTF relationships. Fourth, our factors provide economically meaningful out-of-sample forecasting ability, yielding positive R2 values in 60% of countries and utility gains for mean–variance investors.

However, due to the real-time changes in networks and the complexity of social interactions, analyzing the exact mechanism of the information dissemination process remains extremely difficult. However, conventional popularity prediction methods rely heavily on human expertise to create features and define the generative model, or completely depend on the underlying user relation network for embedding learning. To address these concerns, this proposed work designed an information diffusion prediction model using a Hybrid Graph Convolutional Neural Network–Long Short Term Memory (GCNN–LSTM). The sentiment of the diffused information is analyzed through a hybrid Long Short Term Memory–Support Vector Machine (LSTM–SVM) in social media applications. The proposed work comprises two phases: the first phase is for effective popularity prediction of information diffusion, and the second phase is for analyzing the users' sentiment based on the influence of diffused information. In the detection of the information diffusion phase, the user data from social media is gathered to make a graphical representation based on the comment node attributes, and the effective features are extracted with the assistance of the graph convolutional neural network. After that, the features are given in the LSTM model for the detection of popularity. The diffused information in social media is considered in the sentimental analysis phase; initially, the data is subjected to preprocessing, and features are extracted with Term Frequency Inverse Document Frequency (TFIDF). Finally, with the help of a hybrid LSTM–SVM, the sentiment of the social media data is detected. The proposed model is implemented in MATLAB software and achieved 96% accuracy for phase 1 and 96% for phase 2. Thus, the proposed model effectively detects the spread of information in social media, which can assist various applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Hybrid GCNN–LSTM; Hybrid LSTM–SVM; Information diffusion prediction; Popularity prediction sentiment analysis; TFIDF","Application programs; Convolution; Convolutional neural networks; Data mining; Diffusion; Economic and social effects; Forecasting; Information dissemination; Information use; MATLAB; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Convolutional neural network; Hybrid graph convolutional neural network–long short term memory; Hybrid graphs; Hybrid long short term memory–support vector machine; Information diffusion; Information diffusion prediction; Memory supports; Popularity prediction sentiment analyze; Popularity predictions; Short term memory; Support vectors machine; Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF); Long short-term memory","","","","Doupe Journal of Top Trending Technologies, (2025); Alammary, Ali Saleh, Arabic Questions Classification Using Modified TF-IDF, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 95109-95122, (2021); Alsayat, Ahmed, Improving Sentiment Analysis for Social Media Applications Using an Ensemble Deep Learning Language Model, Arabian Journal for Science and Engineering, 47, 2, pp. 2499-2511, (2022); Ahmad, Faiyaz, Emotion recognition of the driver based on KLT algorithm and ShuffleNet V2, Signal, Image and Video Processing, 18, 4, pp. 3643-3660, (2024); Bohra, Navdeep, Group level social media popularity prediction by MRGB and Adam optimization, Journal of Combinatorial Optimization, 41, 2, pp. 328-347, (2021); International Journal of Advances in Data and Information Systems, (2021); Bronstein, Michael M., Geometric Deep Learning: Going beyond Euclidean data, IEEE Signal Processing Magazine, 34, 4, pp. 18-42, (2017); Chai, Yun, A Stochastic Information Diffusion Model in Complex Social Networks, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 175897-175906, (2019); Chen, Zhanghangjian, Social media information diffusion and excess stock returns co-movement, International Review of Financial Analysis, 91, (2024); Choi, Jiho, Dynamic graph convolutional networks with attention mechanism for rumor detection on social media, PLOS ONE, 16, 8 August, (2021)","","Springer Nature","","","","","","18686478; 18686486","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105008768854"

With increasing use of the internet, daily news is considered to have a substantial influence on bitcoin prices. Traditional methods relying solely on technical indicators or social sentiment often fail to capture the nuanced relationships between these factors, leaving a significant gap in accurately predicting price movements. In this research, we predict bitcoin prices by leveraging news data extracted from Common Crawl News dataset, in conjunction with bitcoin prices obtained from Coinbase Application Programming Interface. We propose a multimodal deep learning model named, Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3.5 (GPT3.5) enhanced Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) Positional encoding-based Transformer Encoder (GPT-CNN-PTEN), designed to predict Bitcoin prices during both bullish and bearish market phases. To achieve this, we employ transformer encoder layers with CNN positional encoding to capture relations in the text and bitcoin prices and handle temporal dependence associated with bitcoin prices. The word embeddings generated using the Ada002 model from the text summarized by GPT3.5 turbo model captures the context of lengthy news articles into concise and meaningful inputs to the model. The dataset from October 2022 to January 2023 was used to train the model. The model was tested on three distinct datasets representing various market conditions. The results are noteworthy achieving mean squared error of 0.001, mean absolute percentage error of 7%. Moreover, the model demonstrated its predictive power by accurately forecasting a bull run hours before it occurred in January 2023. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin; News data; Price prediction; Time series; Transformers","Costs; Deep learning; Encoding (symbols); Forecasting; Investments; Learning systems; Mean square error; Signal encoding; Convolutional neural network; Encodings; Focal points; Learning models; Market price; Multi-modal; News data; Price prediction; Times series; Transformer; Bitcoin; Time series","","","","Ahamed, S.

However, the use of deep generative models in finance remains relatively unexplored. In this paper, we investigate the potential of deep generative diffusion models to estimate unknown dynamics using multiple simulations based on stock chart images. We first demonstrate a novel pre-processing framework and synthetic image generation using opening, high, low, and closing stock chart images to train neural networks. Without assuming the specific process as the underlying asset price process, we can generate synthetic data without predetermined assumptions of the underlying movements of stock prices by trained generative diffusion models. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method successfully replicates well-known asset price processes. With various simulation paths, we can also accurately estimate option pricing on the S &P 500. We conclude that financial simulation with AI can be a novel approach to financial decision-making. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Asset price process; Deep learning; Financial simulation; Generative diffusion model; Option pricing; Price chart","","","","Open Access funding enabled and organized by Seoul National University.

However, previous research often overlooked the depth of analysis generated by LLMs, resulting in reasoning processes inferior to those of human analysts. In fundamental investing, which requires in-depth company analysis, conclusions from imperfect reasoning lack persuasiveness. In this study, inspired by the analysis process of human analysts, we propose an “Analytical Stage-Based Multi-Agent Framework” to enable LLMs to perform in-depth fundamental analysis. This framework divides the analysis into multiple stages, assigning an LLM agent to each. We enhance each agent's capabilities for its specific task through expert guidance or fine-tuning, allowing them to collectively emulate the workflow of human analysts. Furthermore, we introduce Preference-Anchored Likelihood Adjustment, a new method for fine-tuning LLMs. This approach addresses the decline in likelihood of generating correct responses that occurs after using existing preference alignment methods. It employs an objective function with two terms: one to increase likelihood and another to preserve aligned preference. We conducted experiments using our framework to analyze company earnings releases. We evaluated the analysis quality based on comprehensiveness and logical soundness, while correctness was assessed by using stock prices as the ground truth to calculate the Matthews correlation coefficient and F1 score. Results demonstrate that even without expert guidance and fine-tuning, our multi-agent framework can enhance LLMs in both analysis quality and correctness. When combined with expert guidance and fine-tuning, the performance is further improved. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Financial fundamental analysis; Fine-tuning; LLMs; Multi-agent; Stock price analysis","Decentralized finance; Financial markets; Investments; Financial fundamental analyze; Fine tuning; Fundamental analysis; Language model; Large language model; Multi agent; Multiagent framework; Price-analysis; Stock price; Stock price analyze; Cost benefit analysis","","","Funding text 1: This study was supported by Nomura Holdings, Inc, Japan.; Funding text 2: This study was supported by Nomura Holdings, Inc.","Gpt 4 Technical Report, (2023); Ashtiani, Matin N., News-based intelligent prediction of financial markets using text mining and machine learning: A systematic literature review, Expert Systems with Applications, 217, (2023); A General Theoretical Paradigm to Understand Learning from Human Preferences, (2023); Bartram, Söhnke M., Agnostic fundamental analysis works, Journal of Financial Economics, 128, 1, pp. 125-147, (2018); Principles of Corporate Finance, (2000); Noise Contrastive Alignment of Language Models with Explicit Rewards, (2024); Cheng, Dawei, Financial time series forecasting with multi-modality graph neural network, Pattern Recognition, 121, (2022); Provably Robust Dpo Aligning Language Models with Noisy Feedback, (2024); Qlora Efficient Finetuning of Quantized Llms, (2023); Large Language Model Agent in Financial Trading A Survey, (2024)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","26673053","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85219153189"

It reflects the social and material context from which it is derived and in which it is generated. It embeds the purposes, assumptions and rationales of those who produce, collect, use, share and monetize it. In the AI and digital platform economy, data's role is primarily infrastructural. Its core uses are internal to companies. Data only rarely serves as a medium of exchange or commodity, and more frequently serves to profile users, train models, produce predictions, and bundle and extend product capabilities, which in turn are sold to advertisers and other customers. Insofar as they focus on the former, many technical, economic and legal attempts at defining data have inspired reductive policy efforts that include data protection, data ownership, and limited data sharing remedies. This Article argues that understanding data as part of infrastructural pipelines can have significant conceptual and policy implications, and can redirect the way privacy, property and antitrust experts understand and govern data. This argument becomes more salient as market actors and regulators grapple with the catalyzing effects of neural networks and generative AI models on digital markets. In antitrust and competition law especially, regulators are consciously adopting a view of data as an infrastructural input into AI and other digital markets. Treating data as an input in regard to which certain firms have competitive advantages can have significant implications for nascent AI markets, and yet the views in antitrust remain too narrow. Understanding data infrastructurally means viewing it not only as a critical input but also as inseparable from other material digital resources such as protocols, algorithms, semiconductors, and platform interfaces; as having important collective functions; and as calling for public-interest regulation. Understanding data as infrastructure can move us past limited legal efforts and remedial solutions such as data separations, data sharing, and individual controls, and help reorient how data is produced, stored and managed toward public uses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Streinz, Thomas, The Evolution of European Data Law, pp. 902-936, (2021); Future of Economic Statistics, (2015); Household and Establishment Survey Response Rates; Big Data in the U S Consumer Price Index Experiences Plans, (2019); Fourcade, Marion, Seeing like a market, Socio-Economic Review, 15, 1, pp. 9-29, (2017); Seeing Like A State how Certain Schemes to Improve the Human Condition have Failed; Tennessee Law Review, (2018); Mapping Information Economy Business with Big Data Findings from the Uk, (2014); Sadowski, Jathan, When data is capital: Datafication, accumulation, and extraction, Big Data and Society, 6, 1, (2019); Computer Mediated Transactions 100 Am Econ Rev, (2010)","","Walter de Gruyter GmbH","","","","","","15653404; 15651509","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105011616930"

At the other extreme, standard attention-based neural language models (SANLMs)—including encoder–decoder architectures such as Transformers, Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs), and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks—are computationally inexpensive. However, their capacity for semantic reasoning in noisy, open-vocabulary knowledge bases (KBs) remains unquantified. Therefore, we investigate whether compact SANLMs can (i) reason over hybrid OpenIE-derived KBs that integrate commonsense, general-purpose, and non-communicable-disease (NCD) literature; (ii) operate effectively on commodity GPUs; and (iii) exhibit semantic coherence as assessed through manual linguistic inspection. To this end, we constructed four training KBs by integrating ConceptNet (600k triples), a 39k-triple general-purpose OpenIE set, and an 18.6k-triple OpenNCDKB extracted from 1200 PubMed abstracts. Encoder–decoder GRU, LSTM, and Transformer models (1–2 blocks) were trained to predict the object phrase given the subject + predicate. Beyond token-level cross-entropy, we introduced the Meaning-based Selectional-Preference Test (MSPT): for each withheld triple, we masked the object, generated a candidate, and measured its surplus cosine similarity over a random baseline using word embeddings, with significance assessed via a one-sided t-test. Hyperparameter sensitivity (311 GRU/168 LSTM runs) was analyzed, and qualitative frame–role diagnostics completed the evaluation. Our results showed that all SANLMs learned effectively from the point of view of the cross entropy loss. In addition, our MSPT provided meaningful semantic insights: for the GRUs (256-dim, 2048-unit, 1-layer): mean similarity (Formula presented.) of 0.641 to the ground truth vs. 0.542 to the random baseline (gap 12.1%; (Formula presented.)). For the 1-block Transformer: (Formula presented.) vs. (Formula presented.) (gap 4%; (Formula presented.)). While Transformers minimized loss and accuracy variance, GRUs captured finer selectional preferences. Both architectures trained within <24 GB GPU VRAM and produced linguistically acceptable, albeit over-generalized, biomedical assertions. Due to their observed performance, LSTM results were designated as baseline models for comparison. Therefore, properly tuned SANLMs can achieve statistically robust semantic reasoning over noisy, domain-specific KBs without reliance on massive LLMs. Their interpretability, minimal hardware footprint, and open weights promote equitable AI research, opening new avenues for automated NCD knowledge synthesis, surveillance, and decision support. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","chronic diseases; common-sense knowledge; natural language processing; semantic reasoning","Computational linguistics; Diagnosis; Diseases; Entropy; Long short-term memory; Program processors; Semantics; Signal encoding; Chronic disease; Commonsense knowledge; Language model; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Non-communicable disease; Selectional preferences; Semantic reasoning; Short term memory; Natural language processing systems","","","This research was funded by SECIHTI grant number CF-2023-I-2854.

Three different predictive frameworks––fundamental, technical, and entropy-based––are tested through examination of novel combinations of ML- and LLM-derived semantic metrics. The empirical results reveal a considerable divergence in optimal blending methods across the methodologies; namely, the technical methodology exhibits the best performance when using only ML predictions, with around 1978% cumulative returns with monthly rebalancing. In contrast, the fundamental methodology achieves its full potential when it is based primarily on LLM-derived semantic insights. The Entropy methodology is improved by a balanced combination of both semantic and ML signals, thus highlighting the potential of LLMs to improve predictive power by offering interpretative context for complex market interactions.

Recognizing challenges such as variable comment quality, redundancy, and authenticity issues, we propose a multimodal architecture that integrates filtered comment data with stock price dynamics and technical indicators. Using data from nine Chinese banks, we compare four filtering models and demonstrate that employing GPT-4 significantly improves financial metrics like profit-loss ratio, win rate, and excess return rate. The multimodal architecture outperforms baseline models by effectively preprocessing comment data and combining it with quantitative financial data. While focused on Chinese banks, the approach can be adapted to broader markets by modifying the prompts of large language models.

Additionally, patent texts significantly predict the level, volatility, and cumulation speed of future earnings, suggesting they contain genuine information about firms' performance. However, investors do not fully incorporate such information within patent texts into stock prices, as evidenced by the predictive power of patent texts for future stock returns. This underreaction is diminished after the pre-grant publication of patent applications is mandated.

Despite recent advancements in neural networks for extracting latent risk factors, these models remain limited to feature extraction and lack explicit, formulaic risk factor designs. By viewing symbolic mathematics as a language-where valid mathematical expressions serve as meaningful ""sentences""-we propose framing the task of mining formulaic risk factors as a language modeling problem. In this paper, we introduce an end-to-end methodology, Intraday Risk Factor Transformer (IRFT), to directly generate complete formulaic risk factors, including constants. We use a hybrid symbolic-numeric vocabulary where symbolic tokens represent operators and stock features, and numeric tokens represent constants. We train a Transformer model on high-frequency trading (HFT) datasets to generate risk factors without relying on a predefined skeleton of operators (e.g., +, ×, /, √x, log x, cos x). It determines the general form of the stock volatility law, including constants; for example, f (x) = tan(ax + b), where x is the stock price. We refine the predicted constants (a, b) using the Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) algorithm to mitigate non-linear issues. Compared to the ten approaches in SRBench, an active benchmark for symbolic regression (SR), IRFT achieves a 30% higher investment return on the HS300 and S&P500 datasets, while achieving inference times that are orders of magnitude faster than existing methods in HF risk factor mining tasks.

To tackle the limited availability of market prices from brokers, we propose a framework to first augment the model parameters via a generative model, the Variational Autoencoder Generative Adversarial Network (VAE-GAN) model, and then calibrate the model parameters with neural networks to approximate the mapping between synthetic market data and model parameters. In this work, we examine the performance of our two-step calibration approach by comparing it with the traditional calibration process in terms of robustness and efficiency. We evaluate our calibration using two performance metrics employed by major financial institutions. The results indicate that our method not only speeds up the calibration process from hours to seconds but also increases the variety of the dataset, covering a broader range of market conditions. Finally, we use the values output by our calibration method as initial values in the traditional calibrator. This approach helps the traditional calibrator achieve optimal parameters by either improving running time or the quality of the solutions, resulting in a closer match between the model-implied prices and the market prices. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","financial model calibration; generative adversarial network; generative models; stochastic local volatility models; variational autoencoder","Deep learning; Stochastic models; Variational techniques; Adversarial networks; Auto encoders; Financial model calibration; Financial modeling; Generative model; Model calibration; Stochastic local volatility; Stochastic local volatility model; Variational autoencoder; Volatility modeling; Generative adversarial networks","","","","Ihs Markits Totem Service; On Deep Calibration of Rough Stochastic Volatility Models, (2019); Horvath, Blanka N., Deep learning volatility: a deep neural network perspective on pricing and calibration in (rough) volatility models, Quantitative Finance, 21, 1, pp. 11-27, (2021); Bouchouev, Ilia, The inverse problem of option pricing, Inverse Problems, 13, 4, pp. l-11-l17, (1997); Büchel, Patrick, Deep calibration of financial models: turning theory into practice, Review of Derivatives Research, 25, 2, pp. 109-136, (2022); International Journal of Theoretical and Applied Finance Ijtaf, (2020); Foreign Exchange Option Pricing A Practitioner S Guide, (2011); Cuchiero, Christa, A generative adversarial network approach to calibration of local stochastic volatility models, Risks, 8, 4, pp. 1-31, (2020); Cui, Yiran, Full and fast calibration of the Heston stochastic volatility model, European Journal of Operational Research, 263, 2, pp. 625-638, (2017); Deng, Zuicha, An inverse problem of determining the implied volatility in option pricing, Journal of Mathematical Analysis and Applications, 340, 1, pp. 16-31, (2008)","","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM Special Interest Group on Applied Computing (SIGAPP)","40th Annual ACM Symposium on Applied Computing, SAC 2025","","Catania","208932","","9798400706295","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105006436215"

Our two-branch architecture comprises (i) Micro-Stock Encoder, a Mamba-based temporal encoder for processing granular stock-level data (prices, volumes, and technical indicators), and (ii) Macro-Index Analyzer, an LLM module—employing DeepSeek R1 7B distillation—capable of interpreting market-level index trends (e.g., S&P 500) to produce textual summaries. These summaries are then distilled into compact embeddings via FinBERT. By merging these multi-scale representations through a concatenation mechanism and subsequently refining them with multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), MambaLLM dynamically captures both asset-specific price behavior and systemic market fluctuations. Extensive experiments on six major U.S. stocks (AAPL, AMZN, MSFT, TSLA, GOOGL, and META) reveal that MambaLLM delivers up to a 28.50% reduction in RMSE compared with suboptimal models, surpassing traditional recurrent neural networks and MAMBA-based baselines under volatile market conditions. This marked performance gain highlights the framework’s unique ability to merge structured financial time series with semantically rich macroeconomic narratives. Altogether, our findings underscore the scalability and adaptability of MambaLLM, offering a powerful, next-generation tool for financial forecasting and risk management. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","large language model; Mamba; stock price prediction; time series forecasting","","","","This work are supported by the Zhaoqing University Natural Science Fund (File no. 2024BSZ018 and qn202529).","Studies in Informatics and Control, (2000); Franses, Philip Hans, Forecasting stock market volatility using (non-linear) Garch models, Journal of Forecasting, 15, 3, pp. 229-235, (1996); Choo, W.

A diversified portfolio statistically reduces the risk; however, stock choice still substantially influences the profitability. Methods: This work proposes a methodology to automate investment decision recommendations with clear explanations. It utilizes generative AI, guided by prompt engineering, to interpret price predictions derived from neural networks. The methodology also includes the Artificial Intelligence Trust, Risk, and Security Management (AI TRiSM) model to provide robust security recommendations for the system. The proposed system provides long-term investment recommendations based on the financial fundamentals of companies, such as the price-to-earnings ratio (PER) and the net margin of profits over the total revenue. The proposed explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) system uses DeepSeek for describing recommendations and suggested companies, as well as several charts based on Shapley additive explanation (SHAP) values and local-interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIMEs) for showing feature importance. Results: In the experiments, we compared the profitability of the proposed portfolios, ranging from 8 to 28 stock values, with the maximum expected price increases for 4 years in the NASDAQ-100 and S&P-500, where both bull and bear markets were, respectively, considered before and after the custom duties increases in international trade by the USA in April 2025. The proposed system achieved an average profitability of 56.62% while considering 120 different portfolio recommendations. Conclusions: A t-Student test confirmed that the difference in profitability compared to the index was statistically significant. A user study revealed that the participants agreed that the portfolio explanations were useful for trusting the system, with an average score of 6.14 in a 7-point Likert scale. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","DeepSeek; explainable artificial intelligence; financial fundamentals; investment recommendation; stock price prediction; XAI security","","","","This research was funded by the project \u201CProyecto Estrat\u00E9gico de Ciberseguridad Desarrollado en Zonas Escasamente Pobladas\u201D, which was funded by the Instituto Nacional de Ciberseguridad.

This V-shaped return pattern is driven by the strategic sequential disclosure of bad news and good news, aligned with incoming CEOs’ incentives to manage expectations. The pattern is more pronounced when these incentives are stronger, such as when firms earn higher stock returns and have higher valuation uncertainty leading up to the informational events. Evidence from firms’ earnings surprises, analysts’ forecast revisions, and large language model-based measures of disclosure behavior indicates that incoming CEOs often initially release bad news about realized and short-term earnings, projecting a broadly pessimistic outlook for the firm’s future performance, and subsequently disclose favorable news about longer-term earnings prospects. Our findings suggest that investors make the costly mistake of failing to discern the incentives behind managers’ disclosure. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CEO turnover; expectation management; stock returns","","","","Funding text 1: We thank David Solomon (the editor), an anonymous associate editor, and an anonymous referee for their helpful feedback.

Finance comprises various difficult and time-consuming tasks that require significant human effort and are highly prone to errors, such as creating and managing financial documents and reports. Hence, incorporating GAI to simplify processes and make them hassle-free will be consequential. Integrating GAI with finance can open new doors of possibility. With its capacity to enhance decision-making and provide more effective personalised insights, it has the power to optimise financial procedures. In this paper, we address the research gap of the lack of a detailed study exploring the possibilities and advancements of the integration of GAI with finance. We discuss applications that include providing financial consultations to customers, making predictions about the stock market, identifying and addressing fraudulent activities, evaluating risks, and organising unstructured data. We explore real-world examples of GAI, including Finance generative pre-trained transformer (GPT), Bloomberg GPT, and so forth. We look closer at how finance professionals work with AI-integrated systems and tools and how this affects the overall process. We address the challenges presented by comprehensibility, bias, resource demands, and security issues while at the same time emphasising solutions such as GPTs specialised in financial contexts.

Each company's engagement with AI is classified through binary and weighted AI scores based on the frequency of AI-related terms. Using these metrics, we construct four AI stock indices—the Equally Weighted AI Index (AII), the Size-Weighted AI Index (SAII), and two Time-Discounted AI Indices (TAII05 and TAII5X)—offering different perspectives on AI investment. We validate our methodology through an event study on the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT, demonstrating that companies with higher AI engagement saw significantly greater positive abnormal returns, with analyses supporting the predictive power of our AI measures. Our indices perform on par with or surpass 14 existing AI-themed ETFs and the Nasdaq Composite Index in risk-return profiles, market responsiveness, and overall performance, achieving higher average daily returns and risk-adjusted metrics without increased volatility. These results suggest our NLP-based approach offers a reliable, market-responsive, and cost-effective alternative to existing AI-related ETF products.

The study recruited 348 individuals through a non-random snow-ball sampling technique. Utilising ChatGPT for investment recommendations, the research involves a trading experiment accompanied by a two-stage survey to evaluate investor attitudes towards AI before and their cognitive dissonance levels after the experiment. Structural Equation Modelling (SEM) identifies the connection between the intent to use AI and the influence of cognitive dissonance on investment decisions. Results indicate that investors following AI advice outperformed those who did not, attributable not to AI’s predictive power but to reduced cognitive dissonance. This reduction allowed investors using AI to cut losses more effectively, in contrast to those who eschewed AI advice and tended to hold onto losing positions longer, leading to worse performance. Although focused on the cryptocurrency market, the findings suggest a potential for broader applicability in conventional financial markets. The study’s key contribution is demonstrating that AI recommendations can mitigate the disposition effect, implying that AI’s broader implementation could enhance market efficiency. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial intelligence; ChatGPT; Cognitive dissonance; Cryptocurrency; Investment behaviour","","","","","Gharoie Ahangar, Reza, Exploring the potential of ChatGPT in financial decision making, pp. 94-111, (2023); Ahn, Yongkil, The anatomy of the disposition effect: Which factors are most important?, Finance Research Letters, 44, (2022); Action Control from Cognition to Behavior, (1985); Alam, Mahbubul, Survey on Deep Neural Networks in Speech and Vision Systems, Neurocomputing, 417, pp. 302-321, (2020); Anadu, Kenechukwu, The Shift from Active to Passive Investing: Risks to Financial Stability?, Financial Analysts Journal, 76, 4, pp. 23-39, (2020); Aronson, Elliot, The Theory of Cognitive Dissonance: A Current Perspective, Advances in Experimental Social Psychology, 4, C, pp. 1-34, (1969); Ayanwale, Musa Adekunle, Teachers’ readiness and intention to teach artificial intelligence in schools, Computers and Education: Artificial Intelligence, 3, (2022); Ong, Mohd Hanafi Azman, Use and behavioural intention using digital payment systems among rural residents: Extending the UTAUT-2 model, Technology in Society, 74, (2023); Back, Camila, When do robo-advisors make us better investors?

As the GPT-n series has continued to evolve, its applications have garnered considerable attention across various industries, particularly in finance. In contrast, traditional financial research has primarily focused on analyzing structured data such as stock prices. However, recent trends highlight the growing importance of natural language techniques that address unstructured factors like investor sentiment and the impact of news. Positive or negative information about specific companies, industries, or the overall economy found in news or social media can influence investor behavior and market volatility, highlighting the critical need for robust sentiment analysis. In this context, we utilize the state-of-the-art language model GPT and the finance-specific sentiment analysis model FinBERT to perform sentiment and time-series analyses on financial news data, comparing the performance of the two models to demonstrate the potential of GPT. Furthermore, by examining the relationship between sentiment shifts in financial markets and news events, we aim to provide actionable insights for investment decision-making, emphasizing both the performance and interpretability of the models. To enhance the performance of GPT-4o, we employed a systematic approach to prompt design and optimization. This process involved iterative refinement, guided by insights derived from a labeled dataset. This approach emphasized the pivotal importance of prompt design in improving model accuracy, resulting in GPT-4o achieving higher performance than FinBERT. During the experiment phase, sentiment scores were generated from New York Times news data and visualized through time-series graphs for both models. Although both models exhibited similar trends, significant differences arose depending on news content characteristics across categories. According to the results, the performance of GPT-4o, optimized through prompt engineering, outperformed that of FinBERT by up to 10% depending on the sector. These findings emphasize the importance of prompt engineering and demonstrate GPT-4o’s potential to improve sentiment analysis. Furthermore, the categorized news data approach suggests potential applications in predicting the outlook of categorized financial products. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","FinBERT; GPT; prompt design; sentiment analysis; The New York Times","","","","The work of S.-Y.

In this study, we propose a novel hybrid deep learning framework that integrates a large language model (LLM), a Linear Transformer (LT), and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to enhance stock price prediction using solely historical market data. The framework leverages the LLM as a professional financial analyst to perform daily technical analysis. The technical indicators, including moving averages (MAs), relative strength index (RSI), and Bollinger Bands (BBs), are calculated directly from historical stock data. These indicators are then analyzed by the LLM, generating descriptive textual summaries. The textual summaries are further transformed into vector representations using FinBERT, a pre-trained financial language model, to enhance the dataset with contextual insights. The FinBERT embeddings are integrated with features from two additional branches: the Linear Transformer branch, which captures long-term dependencies in time-series stock data through a linearized self-attention mechanism, and the CNN branch, which extracts spatial features from visual representations of stock chart data. The combined features from these three modalities are then processed by a Feedforward Neural Network (FNN) for final stock price prediction. Experimental results on the S&P 500 dataset demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly improves stock prediction accuracy by effectively capturing temporal, spatial, and contextual dependencies in the data. This multimodal approach highlights the importance of integrating advanced technical analysis with deep learning architectures for enhanced financial forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","CNN; deep learning; financial forecasting; Linear Transformer; LLM; stock price prediction","","","","","IEEE Access, (2020); Int J Comput Intell Syst, (2019); IEEE Access, (2021); Proceedings of the 34th Aaai Conference on Artificial Intelligence; Proceedings of the 27th ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management Cikm; Riva, Fabio, Long-term energy planning and demand forecast in remote areas of developing countries: Classification of case studies and insights from a modelling perspective, Energy Strategy Reviews, 20, pp. 71-89, (2018); Ince, Hüseyin, Short term forecasting with support vector machines and application to stock price prediction, International Journal of General Systems, 37, 6, pp. 677-687, (2008); Arxiv, (2018); Panwar, Bhawna, Stock Market Prediction Using Linear Regression and SVM, pp. 629-631, (2021); Hochreiter, Sepp, Long Short-Term Memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217663167"

Different classical approaches that depend on existing approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in image-image-translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting (SHOAGAI-TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique is to accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price prediction. The SHOAGAI-TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and determines the probabilistic prediction from it. To boost the prediction results of the CGAN approach, the hyperparameter tuning can be performed by the use of the SHOA. The simulation result analysis of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique takes place on the stock market dataset. The experimental outcomes determine the significant solution of the SHOAGAI-TSF algorithm with other compared methods in terms of distinct metrics. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence; generative adversarial network; spotted hyena optimization; stock market prediction; time series forecasting","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Probability distributions; Recurrent neural networks; Time series; Effective tool; Forecasting techniques; Hyper-parameter; Optimisations; Optimization algorithms; Optimization techniques; Spotted hyena optimization; Stock market prediction; Time series forecasting; Times series; Generative adversarial networks","","","Funding text 1: This Project was funded by the Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR) at King Abdulaziz University (KAU), Jeddah, Saudi Arabia under grant no.

The development of deep learning methods has evolved from solely considering fundamental price information to a broader spectrum of information, such as sentiment features from news articles. However, these methods often struggle to effectively extract such features when multiple companies are mentioned in a single news article (more details can be referred to Section 1). With the advancement of large language models (LLMs), which can more precisely extract the knowledge people require from text. To overcome the shortcomings of previous work, we propose a novel distillation method for precise knowledge extraction, including sentimental and fine-grained relational knowledge. After that, we incorporate the knowledge as augmented features to assist in the predictions of stock forecasting models.

However, the extent to which Twitter crypto influencer’s posts about trading signals and their effect on market prices is mostly unexplored. In this paper, we use LLMs to uncover buy and not-buy signals from influencers and news outlets’ Twitter posts and use a VAR analysis with Granger Causality tests and cross-correlation analysis to understand how these trading signals are temporally correlated with the top nine major cryptocurrencies’ prices. Overall, the results show a mixed pattern across cryptocurrencies and temporal periods. However, we found that for the top three cryptocurrencies with the highest presence within news and influencer posts, their aggregated LLM-detected trading signal over the preceding 24 h granger-causes fluctuations in their market prices, exhibiting a lag of at least 6 h.

Conversely, the sentiment index derived from financial news data, utilizing a time-varying dictionary, demonstrates improved out-of-sample predictive accuracy for the Ibovespa.

The second strategy, that is using Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) technique achieved a total return of 189.05 %. The AI strategy's excess return of 755.8 % over the XGBoost strategy highlights the significant advantage of AI particularly in utilizing diverse data sources, such as social media, to predict Bitcoin's price trends more effectively than relying solely on economic data.

Traditional forecasting methods, including statistical models and deep learning approaches, often struggle to adapt to rapid market fluctuations and unexpected events such as the COVID-19 pandemic. Moreover, many existing models require large datasets and fail to generalize well across different financial conditions. Addressing these challenges, generative models have gained attention for their ability to generate synthetic financial data and improve prediction accuracy. Here, we propose a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with Gated Recurrent Units (GRU) as the generator and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) as the discriminator to enhance stock price forecasting robustness. Our model is trained using historical stock prices, trading volume, and technical indicators from four major U.S. companies-Apple, Amazon, Google, and Intel-over a period from 2014 to 2023. The dataset is split into pre- and post-COVID-19 periods to assess the model's adaptability to market anomalies. Experimental results indicate that the proposed WGAN-based model achieves an average Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 2.31, outperforming conventional methods such as Linear Regression and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks. Moreover, the model demonstrates minimal performance degradation when exposed to volatile periods, proving its robustness in handling market uncertainties. These findings suggest that WGAN with GRU and CNN is an effective approach to mitigating the impact of market volatility on stock price prediction. Future research will explore further optimizations, alternative generative architectures, and applications to different financial markets to refine prediction accuracy and generalizability. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; GAN; Market Volatility; Stock Price Prediction; Wasserstein GAN","Commerce; Costs; Decision making; Economic analysis; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Large datasets; Mean square error; Neural networks; Adversarial networks; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Financial decisions; GAN; Market volatility; Prediction accuracy; Stock predictions; Stock price prediction; Wasserstein GAN","","","","Sharma, Rishabh, Adaptive Investment Strategies: Deep Reinforcement Learning Approaches for Portfolio Optimization, (2024); Ju, Chernbin, Identifying Financial Market Trend Reversal Behavior with Structures of Price Activities Based on Deep Learning Methods, IEEE Access, 10, pp. 12853-12865, (2022); Xiao, Daiyou, Research on the Application of Generative Adversarial Networks in the Generation of Stock Market Forecast Trend Images, Scientific Programming, 2021, (2021); Liu, Yihang, An Improved Stock Price Prediction Model Based on Generative Adversarial Network, pp. 109-115, (2024); Mane, Vijay Mahadeo, Time Series Forecasting of Stock Prices Using Neural Networks LSTM and GAN, (2025); Ma, Dongbo, VGC-GAN: A multi-graph convolution adversarial network for stock price prediction, Expert Systems with Applications, 236, (2024); Zhang, Kang, Stock Market Prediction Based on Generative Adversarial Network, Procedia Computer Science, 147, pp. 400-406, (2019); Lin, Hung Chun, Stock Price Prediction using Generative Adversarial Networks, Journal of Computer Science, 17, 3, pp. 188-196, (2021)","","Institution of Engineering and Technology","","2025 International Conference on Applied System Innovation, ICASI 2025","","Tokyo","211992","27324494","9781837247028; 9781837247035; 9781837243358; 9781837246847; 9781837246854; 9781837247011; 9781837247004; 9781837247042; 9781837247271; 9781837243143","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016318349"

Although there has been recent increase in acceptance of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) technologies, the current analytical models appear to have limited correspondence with cryptocurrency markets. This work directly addresses price forecasting, fraud detection, sentiment analysis, and risk management, thus illustrating the applicability of the current technologies. We implement complex and novel deep learning techniques such as long short-term memory, gated recurrent unit, Bidirectional-LSTM to explore the temporal and spatial behavior of data associated with cryptocurrencies. These models enable accurate predictions of price and market trends along with reinforcement strategies to refine trading strategies and generative models to assess the market and project what the future might require. This is used to help investors and traders spot patterns in the buying and selling of various crypto currencies, these models might have far-reaching effects on the economy. We compared the suggested model's output with that of current setups.

Traditional machine learning models, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, have shown potential but often fall short in capturing both short-term price fluctuations and long-term dependencies. This paper proposes a novel LSTM-Transformer hybrid model that integrates the sequential modeling capabilities of LSTM with the attention-based long-range pattern recognition of Transformers. To enhance predictive performance, we incorporate key technical indicators-Relative Strength Index (RSI), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Bollinger Bands-as well as sentiment features derived from FinBERT, a finance-specific large language model. The model is trained on historical stock data spanning 2015 to 2024 and evaluated using an 80%-20% training-testing split. Performance is assessed using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE), and Sharpe Ratio to capture both prediction accuracy and risk-adjusted returns. A rolling-window backtesting approach is used to simulate real-world trading behavior across varying market conditions. Our hybrid model outperforms standalone LSTM, GRU, and Transformer baselines, achieving an MSE of 0.0021, RMSE of 0.0467, and a directional accuracy of 76.4%. These findings highlight the value of combining deep learning, financial indicators, and sentiment analysis for robust stock market forecasting. A conceptual extension discussing the role of generative models like GPT for unstructured financial data is also presented. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Algorithmic Trading; Backtesting; Deep Learning; Financial Forecasting; LSTM-Transformer Hybrid; Machine Learning; Sentiment Analysis; Stock Market Prediction; Technical Indicators; Time-Series Analysis","Benchmarking; Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Pattern recognition; Risk assessment; Value engineering; Algorithmic trading; Backtesting; Deep learning; Financial forecasting; Long short-term memory-transformer hybrid; Machine-learning; Sentiment analysis; Short term memory; Stock market prediction; Technical indicator; Time-series analysis; Time series analysis","","","","Can Chatgpt Forecast Stock Price Movements Return Predictability and Large Language Models, (2023); Shobayo, Olamilekan, Innovative Sentiment Analysis and Prediction of Stock Price Using FinBERT, GPT-4 and Logistic Regression: A Data-Driven Approach, Big Data and Cognitive Computing, 8, 11, (2024); Stockgpt A Genai Model for Stock Prediction and Trading, (2024); Quantum Enhanced Forecasting Leveraging Quantum Gramian Angular Field and Cnns for Stock Return Predictions, (2023); Yes It Was Accepted by Ire Journals, (2025); IECE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Artificial Intelligence, (2025); Mitigating Bias in Ai A Framework for Ethical and Fair Machine Learning Models, (2025); Chen, Jia, Gated three-tower transformer for text-driven stock market prediction, Multimedia Tools and Applications, 81, 21, pp. 30093-30119, (2022); Computational Economics, (2022); Thawornwong, Suraphan, Forecasting Stock Returns with Artificial Neural Networks, pp. 47-79, (2003)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","7th IEEE International Conference on Artificial Intelligence Testing, AITest 2025","","Tucson; AZ","211632","","9798331589134","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105016124607"

Our data set includes 3489 stocks from January 2011 to December 2022. Utilizing keywords generated by ChatGPT, we construct a CNU index and estimate the stocks' sensitivity to this uncertainty. Portfolio-level analyzes and cross-sectional regressions indicate a negative cross-sectional relationship between sensitivity to CNU and future stock returns. This relationship remains robust across alternative rolling windows and various measures of the CNU index, and other uncertainty indices cannot account for it. From the perspective of market impediments, arbitrage asymmetry appears to explain this negative relationship.

We provide a dual-layered categorization: first, by financial applications such as stock price forecasting, sentiment analysis, portfolio management, and algorithmic trading; second, by technical methodologies, including prompting, fine-tuning, multi-agent frameworks, reinforcement learning, and custom architectures. Additionally, we consolidate findings on the datasets used, ranging from financial statements to multimodal data (news, market trends, earnings transcripts, social media), and systematically compare general-purpose vs. finance-specialized LLMs used in research. Our analysis identifies key research trends, commonalities, and divergences across studies, evaluating both their empirical contributions and methodological innovations. We highlight the strengths of existing research, such as improved sentiment extraction and the use of reinforcement learning to factor market feedback, alongside critical gaps in scalability, interpretability, and real-world validation. Finally, we propose directions for future research, emphasizing hybrid modeling approaches, architectures that factor reasoning and large context windows, and robust evaluation frameworks to advance AI-driven financial strategies.

Traditional fine-tuning methods struggle to overcome challenges such as low signal-to-noise ratio in numerical time-series data and complex dynamic patterns. To address these challenges, we propose an efficient adaptation framework LLaMA-TTPT for frozen LLMs. LLaMA-TTPT addresses the limitations of utilization efficiency and robustness with multi-modal prompt, cross attention and layer-wise hierarchical prompt propagation. The core innovation of this paper is implicitly mapping temporal data into the semantic space of pretrained LLMs. Firstly, we proposed a temporal-text prompt fine-tuning mechanism, which employes trainable numerical encoders and text prompts to convert stock price sequences into LLM-aligned multi-modal inputs. This enhances cross-modal consistency between numerical features and semantic descriptions. Secondly, we adopt cross attention mechanism to fuse dual-modal embeddings. Finally, we propose a temporal-aware hierarchical soft prompt propagation structure. It combines local dynamic prompt with global trend features extracted through LLMs' self-attention, enabling collaborative modeling of long-short term dependencies. Experiments on India Nifty 50 Stock Market dataset demonstrate that LLaMA-TTPT outperforms mainstream temporal models. Ablation analyses further validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Embedded deployment; Illumination robustness; Large Language Models; Multi-scale feature fusion; Stock Prediction","Dynamics; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Tuning; Embedded deployment; Features fusions; Fine tuning; Illumination robustness; Language model; Large language model; Multi-modal; Multi-scale feature fusion; Multi-scale features; Stock predictions; Forecasting; Semantics","","","","Shah, Jaimin, A comprehensive review on multiple hybrid deep learning approaches for stock prediction, Intelligent Systems with Applications, 16, (2022); Mintarya, Latrisha N., Machine learning approaches in stock market prediction: A systematic literature review, Procedia Computer Science, 216, pp. 96-102, (2022); Rouf, Nusrat Zahan, Stock market prediction using machine learning techniques: A decade survey on methodologies, recent developments, and future directions, Electronics (Switzerland), 10, 21, (2021); Innovations in Applied Engineering and Technology, (2023); Chang, Yupeng, A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 15, 3, (2024); Llama Open and Efficient Foundation Language Models, (2023); Time Llm Time Series Forecasting by Reprogramming Large Language Models, (2023); Lim, Bryan, Temporal Fusion Transformers for interpretable multi-horizon time series forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting, 37, 4, pp. 1748-1764, (2021); Xue, Hao, PromptCast: A New Prompt-Based Learning Paradigm for Time Series Forecasting, IEEE Transactions on Knowledge and Data Engineering, 36, 11, pp. 6851-6864, (2024); P Tuning V2 Prompt Tuning can Be Comparable to Fine Tuning Universally Across Scales and Tasks, (2021)","Jovanovic-Dolecek, G.; Du, K.-L.","SPIE","Academic Exchange Information Centre (AEIC)","5th International Conference on Digital Signal and Computer Communications, DSCC 2025","","Changchun","211255","0277786X; 1996756X","9781510692657; 9781510690561; 9781510693326; 9781510686540; 9781510688728; 9781510693302; 9781510692671; 9781510692251; 9781510692275; 9781510693081","PSISD","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105014159963"

This paper focuses on exploring how to utilize complex networks and sentiment analysis techniques to improve the prediction accuracy of stock movements. We take the semiconductor industry chain stock market as the research object. First, based on complex network theory, we construct a complex network of China’s semiconductor industry chain and extract key network factors. Second, the semantic understanding ability of the large language model is applied to investor comment sentiment analysis, and a multi-dimensional stock sentiment factor is constructed by fine-tuning the GPT large model and combining it with the KNN classifier to recognize investor comment sentiment. Finally, the sentiment factor is combined with the network factors to construct a stock price prediction model using the LSTM algorithm, which is used to predict future stock movements. The experimental results show that the investor sentiment recognition method based on GPT-KNN can obtain an accuracy of 77.59%, which is better than the comparison algorithm, proving the significant advantage of the GPT model in text semantic feature extraction. The average accuracy of the stock trend prediction method integrating multiple factors reaches 69.62%, which is significantly better than the benchmark. Meanwhile, the experimental results of feature combination show that the accuracy is improved by 8.46% and 3.1% by the integration of network factors and sentiment factors, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Complex Network; Sentiment Analysis; Stock Prediction","Classification (of information); Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Learning algorithms; Prediction models; Semiconductor device manufacture; Complex network analysis; Emotional change; Industry chain; Network factors; Prediction-based; Semiconductor industry; Sentiment analysis; Stock movement; Stock predictions; Stock trend prediction; Complex networks","","","","Research on Stock Price Volatility of Listed Companies in the New Energy Industry Chain Based on Complex Networks, (2022); Research on the Time Series Network of Stock Price Volatility Transmission in Chinas New Energy Vehicle Industry Chain, (2021); Zhang, Yongli, Analysis of the global trade network of the chip industry chain: Does the U.S.-China tech war matter?, Heliyon, 9, 6, (2023); Research on the Prediction Scheme of New Energy Concept Index Ups and Downs Based on Cnn Lstm Multi Feature Data Fusion, (2022); Proceedings of the First Workshop on Financial Technology and Natural Language Processing, (2019); J Bus Manage, (2023); Statistics Decision, (2023); Research on Stock Price Prediction Scheme Incorporating Complex Network Indicators, (2022); Attention Based Cnn Lstm and Xgboost Hybrid Model for Stock Prediction Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, (2025); Koratamaddi, Prahlad, Market sentiment-aware deep reinforcement learning approach for stock portfolio allocation, Engineering Science and Technology, an International Journal, 24, 4, pp. 848-859, (2021)","Tan, Y.; Shi, Y.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","9th International Conference on Data Mining and Big Data, DMBD 2024","","Ho Chi Minh City","336179","18650929; 18650937","9789819671779; 9783031949425; 9783032042873; 9783031940019; 9783032008831; 9783031951268; 9783031949555; 9783031937088; 9783031951299; 9783031936302","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105013204500"

Despite their growing popularity, cryptocurrencies can be a high-risk investment due to their price volatility. The inherent volatility in cryptocurrency prices, coupled with the effects of external global economic factors, makes predicting their price movements challenging. To address this challenge, we propose a dynamic Bayesian network (DBN)-based approach to uncover potential causal relationships among various features including social media data, traditional financial market factors, and technical indicators. This study focuses on six major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Binance Coin, Ethereum, Litecoin, Ripple, and Tether. The proposed model’s performance is compared to five baseline models of auto-regressive integrated moving average, support vector regression, long short-term memory, random forests, support vector machines, and a large language model. Results demonstrate that while DBN performance varies across cryptocurrencies, with some cryptocurrencies exhibiting higher predictive accuracy than others, the DBN significantly outperforms the baseline models. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal Feature Engineering; Cryptocurrencies; Dynamic Bayesian Networks; Price Direction Prediction; Social Media","Bayesian networks; Bitcoin; Cost engineering; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Support vector regression; Baseline models; Causal feature engineering; Causal relationships; Dynamic Bayesian networks; Feature engineerings; Investment sector; Performance; Price direction prediction; Risk investment; Social media; Social networking (online)","","","","Maasoumi, Esfandiar (Essie), Contrasting Cryptocurrencies with Other Assets: Full Distributions and the COVID Impact, Journal of Risk and Financial Management, 14, 9, (2021); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Journal of Accounting and Finance, (2023); Charfeddine, Lanouar, Investigating the dynamic relationship between cryptocurrencies and conventional assets: Implications for financial investors, Economic Modelling, 85, pp. 198-217, (2020); Wang, Xingqi, Stock Price Prediction Based on Morphological Similarity Clustering and Hierarchical Temporal Memory, IEEE Access, 9, pp. 67241-67248, (2021); Kumar Kulbhaskar, Anamika, Does Sentiment Impact Cryptocurrency?, Journal of Behavioral Finance, 24, 2, pp. 202-218, (2023); Review of Banking and Financial Law, (2019); Sabry, Farida, Cryptocurrencies and artificial intelligence: Challenges and opportunities, IEEE Access, 8, pp. 175840-175858, (2020); Artificial Intelligence and Transforming Digital Marketing, (2023); Quesada, David, Piecewise forecasting of nonlinear time series with model tree dynamic Bayesian networks, International Journal of Intelligent Systems, 37, 11, pp. 9108-9137, (2022)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","21985804; 21985812","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012586257"

Traditional forecasting methods primarily rely on historical price data, limiting their ability to capture market sentiment embedded in financial news. To address this limitation, we propose MambaMoE, a novel model that integrates historical stock prices with sentiment information extracted from financial news. Specifically, we fine-tune a DeepSeek-based large language model (LLM) for financial sentiment classification and incorporate the extracted sentiment information into our predictive framework. At the core of our approach is MambaMoE layer, which leverages the efficiency of state space models (SSMs) to model long-range dependencies while maintaining linear computational complexity, making it well-suited for financial time series forecasting. Additionally, the Mixture of Experts (MoE) mechanism improves the model’s ability to capture diverse market behaviors by dynamically selecting specialized experts based on stock data patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that MambaMoE outperforms LSTM-based models by 23.7% and Transformer-based models by 6.3%, highlighting its superior performance in short-term stock prediction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","LLM; Mamba; Sentiment analysis; Time series forecasting","Classification (of information); Commerce; Costs; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; State space methods; Time series; Time series analysis; Financial news; Financial time series forecasting; Language model; Large language model; Mamba; Model-driven; Sentiment analysis; State-space; Stock price prediction; Time series forecasting","","","This study has been partially supported by Grant 20240101374JC and Shenzhen Science and Technology Program (JCYJ20230807150300001).","Ainslie, Joshua, GQA: Training Generalized Multi-Query Transformer Models from Multi-Head Checkpoints, pp. 4895-4901, (2023); Blackmamba Mixture of Experts for State Space Models, (2024); Chen, Qizhao, Stock Price Prediction Using LLM-Based Sentiment Analysis, pp. 4846-4853, (2024); Chen, Sian, TSMixer: An All-MLP Architecture for Time Series Forecasting, Transactions on Machine Learning Research, 2023, (2023); Cheng, Dawei, Financial time series forecasting with multi-modality graph neural network, Pattern Recognition, 121, (2022); Cho, Kyunghyun, Learning phrase representations using RNN encoder-decoder for statistical machine translation, pp. 1724-1734, (2014); Dai, Damai, DeepSeekMoE: Towards Ultimate Expert Specialization in Mixture-of-Experts Language Models, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, 1, pp. 1280-1297, (2024); Deepseek R1 Incentivizing Reasoning Capability in Llms Via Reinforcement Learning, (2025); Devlin, Jacob, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, 1, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); An Image is Worth 16x16 Words Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale, (2020)","","Springer","","","","","","15737675; 09259902","","JIISE","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012401844"

Drawing on 4,682 news items linked to 1,258 announcements from 394 S&P 500 companies (January 2023–January 2024), we use ChatGPT to extract sentiment polarity scores and we apply different models to forecast cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) in 30-minute intervals. Our findings reveal that sentiment–especially when captured immediately after news releases–has significant predictive power over intraday price movements.

However, these models are inherently statistical predictors rather than real-time reasoning systems, leading to fundamental limitations in accessing up-to-date information and verifying factual accuracy. This issue is particularly critical in high-stakes domains such as cryptocurrency markets, decentralized finance (DeFi), and autonomous AI agents, where real-time, verifiable, and tamper-proof information is essential for decision-making. In this paper, we introduce AI Oracle, a novel framework that integrates blockchain-powered oracles with LLMs and autonomous agents to ensure real-time access to cryptographically verified knowledge. We compare AI Oracle with both standalone LLMs and retrieval-based systems using the Model Context Protocol (MCP), highlighting significant advantages in factual reliability, adversarial robustness, and interpretability. AI Oracle combines decentralized consensus, immutable storage, and cryptographic attestation to equip AI agents with enhanced resistance to manipulation, hallucination, and misinformation. Beyond architectural improvements, we explore the broader applicability of AI Oracle across domains that require provable correctness and trust - ranging from real-world asset (RWA) tokenization to autonomous agent coordination and decentralized governance. By positioning AI Oracle as a trust-minimized epistemic infrastructure, we propose a new paradigm in AI systems: the fusion of decentralized trust with autonomous reasoning, enabling agents to operate with resilience, transparency, and embedded verifiability across dynamic environments. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","AI Agent; Blockchain Technology; LLM; Price Oracle; RWA","Artificial intelligence; Autonomous agents; Decentralized finance; Electronic money; Intelligent agents; Real time systems; AI agent; Block-chain; Blockchain technology; Decentralised; Human like; Language model; Large language model; Price oracle; Real-world; Real-world asset; Blockchain","","","","Openai, (2024); Agent Ai Surveying the Horizons of Multimodal Interaction, (2024); Llm Powered Autonomous Agents, (2023); Bitcoin A Peer to Peer Electronic Cash System, (2008); Zhai, Sheping, Research on the Application of Cryptography on the Blockchain, Journal of Physics: Conference Series, 1168, 3, (2019); Fu, Shange, On the Shutdown Price of Blockchain Mining Machines, pp. 180-187, (2021); Werner, Sam M., SoK: Decentralized Finance (DeFi), pp. 30-46, (2023); Cefi Vs Defi Comparing Centralized to Decentralized Finance, (2021); Gudgeon, Lewis, DeFi Protocols for Loanable Funds: Interest Rates, Liquidity and Market Efficiency, pp. 92-112, (2020); Ethereum Project Yellow Paper, (2014)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Binance; Bison Digital; Bitcoin Suisse; Bitvavo; Bullish; et al.","2025 Crypto Valley Conference, CVC 2025","","Rotkreuz","210274","","9798331587499","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105012089513"

We collected and extracted stock news headlines from the Chinese stock market and utilized a Large Language Model (LLM) to identify stocks related to the target stock and the relationships among them. Based on these relationships, we constructed a related stock relationship graph. Considering the dynamic changes in the relationship weights between stocks, we employed Graph Attention Networks (GAT) to build a feature fusion model for integrating the features of related stock news. Factors influencing prediction were considered, including different methods of text concatenation, the identification of related stocks, the relationship modeling between related stocks, and the fusion of related stock features. A comparative analysis of the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, the Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) model, and the Long Short-Term Memory with Attention (LSTM-Attention) model revealed that both the news headlines of the target stock and the related stocks, along with their relationships, impact stock price movement prediction.

This paper explores whether sentiment derived from social media discussions can meaningfully predict stock market movements. We focus on Reddit’s r/wallstreetbets and analyze sentiment related to two companies: GameStop (GME) and AMC Entertainment (AMC). To assess sentiment’s role, we employ two existing text-based sentiment analysis methods and introduce a third, a ChatGPT-annotated and fine-tuned RoBERTa-based model designed to better interpret the informal language and emojis prevalent in social media discussions. We use correlation and causality metrics to determine these models’ predictive power. Surprisingly, our findings suggest that social media sentiment has only a weak correlation with stock prices. At the same time, simpler metrics, such as the volume of comments and Google search trends, exhibit stronger predictive signals.

By applying Lag-Llama to both univariate and multi-time series forecasts of key IDX stocks, we assess its ability to capture temporal patterns and market volatility, particularly in comparison to state-of-the-art models like DeepAR (RNN) and Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT). Our results show that in fine-tuning scenarios Lag-Llama achieves a Continuous Ranked Proba-bility Score (CRPS) of 0.0195 on a combined dataset of three major stocks (BBCA, BMRI, and AMRT), closely matching TFT (CRPS 0.0179) and outperforming DeepAR (CRPS 0.0270). However, forecasting across broader stock groups (Top 1–9 and Top 10–18 by market cap-italization) proves more challenging, with CRPS values rising (e.g. 0.0517 for the Top 1– 9 stocks). This study demonstrates Lag-Llama’s potential as a robust tool for stock price prediction—particularly for select, closely-related stock groupings—offering improved precision and reliability compared to traditional methods. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Lag-Llama; Large Language Models; Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting; Stock Market Analysis","","","","This research was funded by Universitas Islam Riau under Joint Research Project UTP-UMP-TelU-UIR (1058/KONTRAK/DPPM-UIR-12-2022).","Corizzo, Roberto, Stock market prediction with time series data and news headlines: a stacking ensemble approach, Journal of Intelligent Information Systems, 62, 1, pp. 27-56, (2024); Kumar, Raghavendra, Multi-step time series analysis and forecasting strategy using ARIMA and evolutionary algorithms, International Journal of Information Technology (Singapore), 14, 1, pp. 359-373, (2022); Azevedo, Vitor Gonçalves, Stock market anomalies and machine learning across the globe, Journal of Asset Management, 24, 5, pp. 419-441, (2023); Olorunnimbe, Kenniy, Deep learning in the stock market—a systematic survey of practice, backtesting, and applications, Artificial Intelligence Review, 56, 3, pp. 2057-2109, (2023); Theor Econ Lett, (2021); Soft Computing Theories and Applications, (2022); Indian Journalof Data Mining Ijdm, (2024); Tang, Jinqi, Stock market prediction based on historic prices and news titles, ACM International Conference Proceeding Series, pp. 29-34, (2018); Stock Return Prediction by History Mapping, (2011); Journal of Computer Science and Technology Studies, (2024)","","Shimur Publications","","","","","","25829793","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Bronze Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105010653158"

While many recent transformer models attempt to extend their context length over a million tokens, they remain impractical due to the quadratic time and space complexities. Although recent works on linear and sparse attention mechanisms can achieve this goal, their real-world applicability is often limited by the need to re-train from scratch and significantly worse performance. In response, we propose a novel approach, Hierarchically Pruned Attention (HiP), which reduces the time complexity of the attention mechanism to O(T log T) and the space complexity to O(T), where T is the sequence length. We notice a pattern in the attention scores of pretrained LLMs where tokens close together tend to have similar scores, which we call “attention locality”. Based on this observation, we utilize a novel tree-search-like algorithm that estimates the top-k key tokens for a given query on the fly, which is mathematically guaranteed to have better performance than random attention pruning. In addition to improving the time complexity of the attention mechanism, we further optimize GPU memory usage by implementing KV cache offloading, which stores only O(log T) tokens on the GPU while maintaining similar decoding throughput. Experiments on benchmarks show that HiP, with its training-free nature, significantly reduces both prefill and decoding latencies, as well as memory usage, while maintaining high-quality generation with minimal degradation. HiP enables pretrained LLMs to scale up to millions of tokens on commodity GPUs, potentially unlocking long-context LLM applications previously deemed infeasible. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","This work was supported by the Institute for Information & communications Technology Planning & Evaluation(IITP) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (RS-2019-II190075, Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program (KAIST); No.RS-2019-II191906, Artificial Intelligence Graduate School Program (POSTECH); No.RS-2024-00459797, Development of ML compiler framework for on-device AI; No.RS-2022-II220713, Meta-learning Applicable to Real-world Problems), the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korean government (MSIT) (No. RS-2024-00354947; No. RS-2023-00256259) and the NAVER-Intel Co-Lab.

This study addresses these challenges by integrating sentiment analysis with advanced deep learning and machine learning architectures within a multi-model framework. Over two thousand financial news headlines were collected from leading economic websites using web scraping tools such as Selenium and BeautifulSoup, forming the basis for sentiment analysis. The sentiment data was processed using cutting edge natural language processing techniques, including Zero-Shot learning with GPT-4 and GEMINI Advanced models, selected for their proficiency in handling unlabeled financial sentiment data. The proposed solution combines sentiment scores with technical and fundamental market indicators, feeding these into diverse predictive models, including Long Short-Term Memory networks, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and Transformer architectures in encoder-decoder and decoder-only configurations. This approach captures the nuanced effects of market sentiment within a four-hour trading window, aligning closely with real-time market dynamics. The key findings indicate that integrating sentiment analysis significantly improves prediction accuracy, with the XGBoost model demonstrating superior performance when combined with technical, fundamental, and sentiment data. The study reveals that while this multi-model approach offers improved predictive capabilities, it also faces limitations such as dependency on high-quality sentiment data and the computational intensity of training complex models. These results suggest that the integration of sentiment analysis provides a competitive edge in forex forecasting, though further research is needed to refine these methods and address their limitations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Forex prediction; LSTM; Sentiment analysis; Transformer; XGBoost","Commerce; Data mining; Decoding; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Memory architecture; Websites; Economic factors; Forex prediction; LSTM; Modeling approach; Multi-modelling; Price prediction; Sentiment analysis; Transformer; Transformer modeling; Xgboost","","","","Hu, Zexin, A survey of forex and stock price prediction using deep learning, Applied System Innovation, 4, 1, pp. 1-30, (2021); Rundo, Francesco, Machine learning for quantitative finance applications: A survey, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 9, 24, (2019); Dautel, Alexander Jakob, Forex exchange rate forecasting using deep recurrent neural networks, Digital Finance, 2, 1-2, pp. 69-96, (2020); Ni, Lina, Forecasting of Forex Time Series Data Based on Deep Learning, Procedia Computer Science, 147, pp. 647-652, (2019); Yıldırım, Deniz Can, Forecasting directional movement of Forex data using LSTM with technical and macroeconomic indicators, Financial Innovation, 7, 1, (2021); Tripathi, Manas, Exchange Rate Forecasting Using Ensemble Modeling for Better Policy Implications, Journal of Time Series Econometrics, 13, 1, pp. 43-71, (2021); Data Selection to Avoid Overfitting for Foreign Exchange Intraday Trading with Machine Learning, (2021); undefined; undefined; Explaining Exchange Rate Forecasts with Macroeconomic Fundamentals Using Interpretive Machine Learning, (2023)","Ullah, A.; Anwar, S.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","18th International Conference on Information Technology and Applications, ICITA 2024","","Sydney; NSW","333819","23673389; 23673370","9783031950162; 9789819657506; 9783032004406; 9783031967740; 9783031926105; 9789819667208; 9789819662999; 9789819641505; 9783032000705; 9783031999963","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009409984"

To understand the views of people and sentimental tendencies on a commodity or an event in a timely manner, it is essential to conduct sentiment analysis (SA) on the views that are expressed by users. For longer text data, it comprises various contents and the correlation among words is more complicated than the short text. To bridge this gap, a random multi-hierarchical attention network (RMHAN) is introduced for SA using text reviews. First, the input review is passed to bidirectional encoder representation from transformers (BERTs) tokenization, which breaks the text into individual tokens, and the output-1 is obtained. Likewise, input review is passed to the retrieval-augmented generation-large language model (RAG-LLM) for recognizing, translating, predicting, or generating text or additional content, and thus, output-2 is accomplished. Thereafter, the tokenized word is passed to the feature extraction phase for extracting the features. Then, SA is conducted employing RMHAN. Here, RMHAN is the combination of random multimodel deep learning (RMDL) and hierarchical attention network (HAN), where layers are modified employing the Taylor network with some forward methodology. It can be noticed that RMHAN accomplished a better accuracy of 91.90%, a precision of 91.70%, and an F1-score of 89.10%. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","hierarchical attention network; random multimodel deep learning; retrieval-augmented generation; Sentiment analysis; term frequency-inverse document frequency","Computational linguistics; Data mining; Deep learning; Information retrieval; Information retrieval systems; Inverse problems; Learning systems; Reviews; Social networking (online); Tantalum compounds; Hierarchical attention network; Language model; Model-based OPC; Multi-hierarchical; Multi-modelling; Random multimodel deep learning; Retrieval-augmented generation; Sentiment analysis; Social media networks; Term frequencyinverse document frequency (TF-IDF)","","","","Proc Natl Conf Recent Innovations in Emerging Computer Technologies Ncriect, (2023); Gangal, Anushka, Natural language processing: A review, AIP Conference Proceedings, 2771, 1, (2023); Cross Domain Consumer Review Analysis, (2022); A Comprehensive Review on Sentiment Analysis Tasks Approaches and Applications, (2023); Emotion Measurement, (2021); Semantic Sentiment Analysis Based on Probabilistic Graphical Models and Recurrent Neural Network, (2020); Int J Comput Trends Technol, (2022); Interpretable Multimodal Sentiment Analysis Based on Textual Modality Descriptions by Using Large Scale Language Models, (2023); Sentiment Analysis Through Llm Negotiations, (2023); Gonçalves, Pollyanna, Comparing and combining sentiment analysis methods, pp. 27-37, (2013)","","World Scientific","","","","","","14690268; 17575885","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009369787"

Specifically, we use the Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN) as the generative model and use the resulting setup, HMM-WGAN, for simulating multivariate stock returns. In line with the original GAN model for images, we depict the invisible hands in financial markets as market painters and the different market regimes as distinct observable painting styles. The framework comprises of two phases. In Phase I, we train a time-homogeneous HMM to identify market painters for each trading day using a set of realized exogenous features. In Phase II, the painting style for each market painter is learned adversarially from a set of realized stock returns using WGAN. Subsequently, the market painter for the next trading day is simulated with the current regime and the trained HMM's transition matrix, and the consequent painting, i.e. multivariate stock returns, is then generated using the market painter's trained WGAN generator. Our empirical results demonstrate that the simulated multivariate stock returns not only replicate a comprehensive set of well-documented stylized facts—including heavy-tailed distributions, volatility clustering, and leverage effects—but also yield a more robust value-at-risk estimates compared to traditional approaches. As such, our framework provides a flexible, data-driven alternative to conventional parametric models without imposing restrictive assumptions. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Generative models; Hidden Markov models; Risk measurement; Stock market simulation; Stylized facts","","","","Chi Seng Pun gratefully acknowledges Ministry of Education (MOE), AcRF Tier 2 grant (Reference No: MOE-T2EP20220-0013) for the funding of this research.","Al-Hmouz, Rami, Description and prediction of time series: A general framework of Granular Computing, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 10, pp. 4830-4839, (2015); undefined; undefined; Barak, Sasan, Developing an approach to evaluate stocks by forecasting effective features with data mining methods, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 3, pp. 1325-1339, (2015); Baum, Leonard E., An inequality with applications to statistical estimation for probabilistic functions of markov processes and to a model for ecology, Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, 73, 3, pp. 360-363, (1967); Annals of Mathematical Statistics, (1966); Baum, Leonard E., Growth transformations for functions on manifolds, Pacific Journal of Mathematics, 27, 2, pp. 211-227, (1968); Bekaert, Geert, Asymmetric Volatility and Risk in Equity Markets, Review of Financial Studies, 13, 1, pp. 1-42, (2000); Biau, Gérard, Some theoretical properties of gans, Annals of Statistics, 48, 3, pp. 1539-1566, (2020); Bollerslev, Tim, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Journal of Econometrics, 31, 3, pp. 307-327, (1986)","","Routledge","","","","","","14697688; 14697696","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105009009501"

These mechanisms are pivotal for effectively capturing complex data dependencies and relationships, which is crucial for tasks such as natural language understanding and generation. However, as dimensionality increases, self-attention mechanisms face significant challenges related to computational efficiency and scalability. This paper introduces an encoding-based quantum self-attention mechanism designed to address these issues by embedding classical data into quantum states. This approach facilitates more efficient computation and reduces model complexity. To further enhance performance for real-world applications, particularly in financial time series forecasting, we propose a hybrid model that integrates Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks with quantum self-attention mechanism. Given the constraints of the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, this hybrid approach represents a plausible solution, leveraging the strengths of both classical and quantum methods and focusing on achieving faster convergence.

Our study introduces a hybrid model that integrates traditional sequential prediction models with GPT-4, aiming to generate detailed, context-sensitive explanations for model outputs. This approach is rooted in the use of advanced transformer architectures and a specialized tokenization method that maintains semantic coherence, allowing for deep contextual analysis by GPT-4. Additionally, we devise a rationale generation algorithm that achieves a balance between succinctness and informativeness. Our experimental validation spans across various high-dimensional datasets, including financial time-series and multilingual texts, employing both qualitative and quantitative metrics to evaluate the model’s performance. These metrics focus on the plausibility and consistency of the rationales, as well as the model’s predictive accuracy. Preliminary results demonstrate that our approach not only enhances the accuracy of sequential predictions but also significantly improves their interpretability.

We implement a few-shot learning technique, followed by Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) enhanced with comprehensive up-to-date financial data, using Meta's latest LLM, Llama 3.1-8b. In the first phase, We assess the models' efficacy using key financial indicators, including total returns, annualized volatility, riskadjusted performance (Sharpe ratio), potential loss estimates (value-at-risk), and their pre-training knowledge with the S&P 500 Index performance baseline. In the second phase, we enhance the LLM's knowledge base by RAG and the latest historical and statistical metrics (such as earnings per share (EPS), dividends per share (DPS), profit margin, and many more) for each asset from different classes. The study constrains model inputs to specific sets of financial assets, such as equities, exchangetraded funds (ETFs), commodities, cryptocurrencies, and bonds. To evaluate model performance and adaptability, we analyzed across two distinct time frames: (1) within the models' training data cutoff, and (2) from the cutoff date to the present. This approach enables the assessment of model generalization to past and present market conditions. The research quantifies LLMs' capabilities in financial asset allocation, comparing baseline performance against RAG-augmented strategies. Our results demonstrate that RAG-enhanced LLM significantly outperforms vanilla LLM in portfolio construction across various asset classes.

Traditional methods like content based and collaborative filtering work well for smaller datasets but often fail to extract information from large datasets due to their limited ability to capture complex patterns. This paper introduces a novel approach for stock recommendation that leverages a large language model, Llama 3.1, fine-tuned on financial news data. Financial news headlines and summaries were collected using the FinnHub API which served as the primary dataset. The system integrates stock price forecasting, sentiment analysis, and performance indicators to generate an effective analysis for decision making. The forecasting algorithm generates the stock price predictions which were integrated with sentiment analysis and stock performance indicators to create an informative prompt-response dataset for fine-tuning. The proposed system ranks stocks based on positive developments, potential concerns, and forecasted closing prices, providing Buy or Sell recommendations. Experimental results demonstrated moderate performance for predicting Buy recommendations, while Sell predictions exhibited lower accuracy comparatively. Analysis based on sectors revealed that the consumer cyclical and healthcare sectors yielded the best performance for Buy and Sell recommendations, respectively. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Ranking Algorithm; Recommender Systems","Cost benefit analysis; Decision making; Content-based; Financial news; Informed decision; Language model; Large language model; Performance; Performance indicators; Ranking algorithm; Sentiment analysis; Stock analysis; Recommender systems","","","","Gómez-Uribe, Carlos A., The netflix recommender system: Algorithms, business value, and innovation, ACM Transactions on Management Information Systems, 6, 4, (2015); A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, (1892); Amazon Product Recommender System, (2021); Schafer, J.

Recognizing the limitations of traditional models—which often overlook emerging “novel risks”—the article leverages advanced large language models (LLMs) to extract and quantify key risk factors, including ESG, geopolitical, and supply chain disruption risks, from corporate disclosures. These LLM-derived risk scores are then combined with conventional financial indicators such as leverage, beta, and short interest, and incorporated into a long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network to predict firm-specific (idiosyncratic) volatility. Empirical analysis, conducted on over 18,000 regulatory filings spanning 2015 to 2024, demonstrates that the integrated model significantly improves volatility forecasting, as evidenced by enhanced R2 values and reduced mean squared error. Additionally, feature importance analyses confirm the pivotal role of novel risk measures. Overall, the findings underscore the benefits of merging unstructured and hard to quantify data with quantitative models to offer a more nuanced approach to estimation of novel financial risk. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Alan, Nazli Sila, Impact of Language Complexity on Volatility in Financial Markets: Evidence from Textual Analysis of Earnings Calls, Journal of Portfolio Management, 50, 2, pp. 27-57, (2023); Corporate Social Responsibility and Firm Risk Theory and Empirical Evidence, (2018); Fat Tail the Power of Political Knowledge for Strategic Investing, (2009); Risklabs Predicting Financial Risk Using Large Language Model Based on Multi Sources Data, (2024); Cheng, Beiting, Corporate social responsibility and access to finance, Strategic Management Journal, 35, 1, pp. 1-23, (2014); Engle, Robert F., News and Idiosyncratic Volatility: The Public Information Processing Hypothesis, Journal of Financial Econometrics, 19, 1, pp. 1-38, (2021); Long Short Term Memory Neural Network for Financial Time Series, (2022); Hochreiter, Sepp, Long Short-Term Memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Ilhan, Emirhan, Carbon Tail Risk, Review of Financial Studies, 34, 3, pp. 1540-1571, (2021); Inoue, Hiroyasu, Firm-level propagation of shocks through supply-chain networks, Nature Sustainability, 2, 9, pp. 841-847, (2019)","","Portfolio Management Research","","","","","","00954918","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105004471218"

However, predicting stock price fluctuations remains a significant challenge, mainly due to the following two aspects: Lack Interpretability: Traditional methods usually lack interpretability, making it difficult for people to understand why the model predicts a rise or fall in stock prices. In the highly volatile financial market, since people often need to rely on professional judgment when making decisions, the quality of the reasoning provided by the model can sometimes be even more important than the accuracy of the model’s predictions.Model prediction bias: When generating rationales, models tend to favor a certain label, causing the final output of the model to lack reference significance. Lack Interpretability: Traditional methods usually lack interpretability, making it difficult for people to understand why the model predicts a rise or fall in stock prices. In the highly volatile financial market, since people often need to rely on professional judgment when making decisions, the quality of the reasoning provided by the model can sometimes be even more important than the accuracy of the model’s predictions. Model prediction bias: When generating rationales, models tend to favor a certain label, causing the final output of the model to lack reference significance. To address these challenges, we propose a new framework. We independently trained two models, TechGPT and SentiGPT, to analyze stock price data and text data from community platforms, respectively. By combining the outputs of TechGPT and SentiGPT, we developed a comprehensive model named IntegraGPT. During the training data collection process, we used In-Context Learning to require multiple large language models to generate reasoning rationales, avoiding reliance on a single large language model for reasoning. This approach addresses the issues of insufficient interpretability and model prediction bias. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Languange Model; Natural Language Processing; Stock Movement Prediction","Computational cost; Interpretability; Language model; Language processing; Large languange model; Movement prediction; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Stock movement; Stock movement prediction; Stock price; Natural language processing systems","","","","Alphafin Benchmarking Financial Analysis with Retrieval Augmented Stock Chain Framework, (2024); Can Chatgpt Forecast Stock Price Movements Return Predictability and Large Language Models, (2023); Large Language Models A Survey, (2024); Ploutos Towards Interpretable Stock Movement Prediction with Financial Large Language Model, (2024); Alpha Gpt Human Ai Interactive Alpha Mining for Quantitative Investment, (2023); Instruction Data and Evaluation Benchmark for Finance, (2023); Xu, Yumo, Stock movement prediction from tweets and historical prices, 1, pp. 1970-1979, (2018)","Chu, W.-T.; Shen, C.-Y.; Shuai, H.-H.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","29th International Conference on Technologies and Applications of Artificial Intelligence, TAAI 2024","","Hsinchu","330309","18650929; 18650937","9789819671779; 9783031949425; 9783032042873; 9783031940019; 9783032008831; 9783031951268; 9783031949555; 9783031937088; 9783031951299; 9783031936302","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105003857146"

As LLM-assisted services become popular, achieving cost-effective LLM inference on budget-friendly hardware becomes the current trend. This has sparked extensive research into relocating LLM parameters from expensive GPUs to external host memory. However, the restricted bandwidth between the host and GPU memory limits the inference performance of existing solutions. This work introduces Hermes, a budget-friendly system that leverages the near-data processing units (NDP) within commodity DRAM DIMMs to enhance the performance of a single consumer-grade GPU, achieving efficient LLM inference. We recognize that the inherent activation sparsity in LLMs naturally divides weight parameters into two categories, termed 'hot' and 'cold' neurons, respectively. Hot neurons, which consist of only approximately 20% of all weight parameters, account for 80% of the total computational load. In contrast, cold neurons make up the other 80% of parameters but are responsible for just 20% of the computational workload. Leveraging this observation, we propose a heterogeneous computing strategy: mapping hot neurons to a single computation-efficient GPU without large-capacity HBMs, while offloading cold neurons to NDP-DIMMs, which offer large memory size but limited computation capabilities. In addition, the dynamic nature of activation sparsity necessitates a real-time partition of hot and cold neurons and adaptive remapping of cold neurons across multiple NDP-DIMM modules. To tackle these issues, we introduce a lightweight predictor that ensures optimal real-time neuron partition and adjustment between GPU and NDP-DIMMs. Furthermore, we utilize a window-based online scheduling mechanism to maintain load balance among multiple NDP-DIMM modules. In summary, Hermes facilitates the deployment of LLaMA2-70B on consumer-grade hardware at a rate of 13.75 tokens/s and realizes an average 75.24 × speedup over the state-of-the-art offloading-based inference system on popular LLMs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Analog storage; Computer graphics equipment; Graphics processing unit; Neurons; Problem oriented languages; Static random access storage; 'current; Computational loads; Cost effective; Data processing units; Language model; Model inference; Modeling parameters; Performance; Real- time; Weight parameters; Budget control","","","We sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers for their insightful suggestions.

Excessive rebalancing, while addressing supply-demand imbalances, causes financial burdens and resource waste. Hence, long-term daily operations (e.g., rebalancing at midnights for upcoming days) have practical economic significance, but they remain underexplored due to difficulties in tracking high within-day and between-day demand variability and the interplay between demand and daily inventory management strategies. Besides, cooperative operation of bikes and ebikes expands solution space, given their inherent demand coupling. This study is the first to explore long-term daily inventory strategies for the hybrid system (ebikes get charged at stations), determining spatial-heterogeneous inventory at midnight to maximize profits. To address the demand variability perception issue, we develop a recurrent-attentive neural process (RANP) model to predict hour-to-hour demand of the upcoming day. The RANP is integrated into a long-term optimization model, referred to as the generative-models-informed Markov decision process (GMI-MDP), where two cooperative intelligent agents determine the bike–ebike allocation based on demand perception and system rewards. A suite of numerical experiments utilizing a real-world dataset from New York is carried out, and various strategies are compared. The proposed method, through online and offline tests, demonstrates superiority over other MDP-based and rule-based methods, achieving a faster solution-seeking process and more stable rewards than MDP with exact upcoming demand. By comparing inventory volatility, we offer insights into managerial operations. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bike–ebike allocation; generative models; long-term management; Markov decision process (MDP)","","","","","Chen, Mingxuan, A static green bike repositioning problem with heavy and light carriers, Transportation Research Part D: Transport and Environment, 118, (2023); Shi, Ziyi, Multi-Platform dynamic game and operation of hybrid Bike-Sharing systems based on reinforcement learning, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 181, (2024); Fu, Chenyi, Bike-sharing inventory management for market expansion, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 162, pp. 28-54, (2022); Ho, Sin C., A hybrid large neighborhood search for the static multi-vehicle bike-repositioning problem, Transportation Research Part B: Methodological, 95, pp. 340-363, (2017); Lee, Gaeun, Battery swapping, vehicle rebalancing, and staff routing for electric scooter sharing systems, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 186, (2024); Xu, Meng, Multi-task supply-demand prediction and reliability analysis for docked bike-sharing systems via transformer-encoder-based neural processes, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 147, (2023); Zhu, Zheng, Day-to-day evolution of departure time choice in stochastic capacity bottleneck models with bounded rationality and various information perceptions, Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 131, pp. 168-192, (2019); Li, Xinyu, Improving short-term bike sharing demand forecast through an irregular convolutional neural network, Transportation Research Part C: Emerging Technologies, 147, (2023); Zhu, Zheng, Fitting Spatial-Temporal Data via a Physics Regularized Multi-Output Grid Gaussian Process: Case Studies of a Bike-Sharing System, IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems, 23, 11, pp. 21090-21101, (2022); A Reinforcement Learning Approach for Dynamic Rebalancing in Bike Sharing System, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","2329924X","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105002861848"

As one of the main financial assets, stocks are also influenced by various external factors, such as economic conditions, government policies, and market sentiment. All of these factors play a crucial role in determining stock price movements. This study integrates sentiment analysis with the XGBoost algorithm to predict IHSG stock prices. By utilizing historical stock data and sentiment derived from financial news, the study evaluates the impact of sentiment data integration on prediction accuracy. Three types of returns (absolute, relative, and logarithmic) and five sentiment scenarios were employed to assess the contribution of sentiment features to the prediction model. The results indicate that sentiment integration consistently improves the predictive performance of the model compared to using historical data alone. Among the tested scenarios, Scenario 2, 4, and 5 demonstrated the best performance, with an RMSE value of 0.009163 and an MAE value of 0.007432, using the logarithmic return type.

This paper introduces ElliottAgents, an multi-agent system that integrates the Elliott Wave Principle with AI for stock market forecasting. The inherent complexity of financial markets, characterized by non-linear dynamics, noise, and susceptibility to unpredictable external factors, poses significant challenges for accurate prediction. To address these challenges, the system employs LLMs to enhance natural language understanding and decision-making capabilities within a multi-agent framework. By leveraging technologies such as Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), ElliottAgents performs continuous, multi-faceted analysis of market data to identify wave patterns and predict future price movements. The research explores the system’s ability to process historical stock data, recognize Elliott wave patterns, and generate actionable insights for traders. Experimental results, conducted on historical data from major U.S. companies, validate the system’s effectiveness in pattern recognition and trend forecasting across various time frames. This paper contributes to the field of AI-driven financial analysis by demonstrating how traditional technical analysis methods can be effectively combined with modern AI approaches to create more reliable and interpretable market prediction systems. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Abrishami, Soheila, Enhancing profit by predicting stock prices using deep neural networks, 2019-November, pp. 1551-1556, (2019); Ire J, (2021); Generative AI with Langchain Build Large Language Model Llm Apps with Python Chatgpt and Other Llms, (2023); Fibonacci Trading how to Master the Time and Price Advantage, (2008); Understand the Llm Agent Orchestration, (2024); Chateval Towards Better Llm Based Evaluators Through Multi Agent Debate, (2023); Chudziak, Adam, Predictability of stock returns using neural networks: Elusive in the long term, Expert Systems with Applications, 213, (2023); Proceedings of the 38th Pacific Asia Conference on Language Information and Computation, (2024); Exploring Large Language Model Based Intelligent Agents Definitions Methods and Prospects, (2024); Retrieval Augmented Generation for Knowledge Intensive Nlp Tasks, (2020)","Rocha, A.P.; Steels, L.; van den Herik, H.J.","Science and Technology Publications, Lda","","17th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence, ICAART 2025","","Porto","328949","21843589; 2184433X","9789897583957; 9789897586231; 9789897583506; 9789897585470; 9789897584848","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001682256"

This study utilizes data from social media to extract the emotional tendencies of investors in the Bitcoin market and analyze differences in investor behavior under various emotional features. We find that when investors exhibit reluctance (such as Sadness and Fear) to buy Bitcoin, it is the opportune moment to invest and achieve returns higher than expected. Conversely, when the emotional tone of investors becomes positive (such as Joy and Love), indicating a tendency to invest, we choose to avoid investing. Our research has also revealed that such emotional cues can assist in better predicting returns in the Bitcoin market. Analyzing market emotions contributes to a deeper understanding of market fluctuations and investor behavior. Our findings help stakeholders recognize the role of subjective emotions in the market and provide them with prudent investment advice: avoid relying excessively on the feelings of others, as this may trigger investment losses. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","BERT; bitcoin; investor behavior; large language models; machine learning; return prediction; textual analysis","BERT; Investor behavior; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Market fluctuations; Return prediction; Social media; Textual-analysis; Bitcoin","","","This work was supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China under Grant 72403258, in part by the National Social Science Fund of China under Grant 24CJL043, in part by the Excellent Young Scholar Project of the Hunan Provincial Department of Education under Grant 23B0004, in part by the Innovation and Talent Base for Digital Technology and Finance under Grant B21038, and in part by \u201Cthe Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities\u201D, Zhongnan University of Economics and Law under Grant 2722024EJ011","Wu, Deshengdash Dash, A decision support approach for online stock forum sentiment analysis, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 44, 8, pp. 1077-1087, (2014); Khadjeh Nassirtoussi, Arman K., Text mining for market prediction: A systematic review, Expert Systems with Applications, 41, 16, pp. 7653-7670, (2014); Kaplanski, Guy, Sentiment and stock prices: The case of aviation disasters, Journal of Financial Economics, 95, 2, pp. 174-201, (2010); Zhou, Guofu, Measuring investor sentiment, Annual Review of Financial Economics, 10, pp. 239-259, (2018); Gambetti, Elisa, The effect of anger and anxiety traits on investment decisions, Journal of Economic Psychology, 33, 6, pp. 1059-1069, (2012); Duclos, Rod, The psychology of investment behavior: (De)biasing financial decision-making one graph at a time, Journal of Consumer Psychology, 25, 2, pp. 317-325, (2014); Zhou, Yanmengqian, Perceived risk, emotions, and stress in response to COVID-19: The interplay of media use and partisanship, Risk Analysis, 43, 8, pp. 1572-1586, (2023); Jha, Manish, Natural Disaster Effects on Popular Sentiment Toward Finance, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 56, 7, pp. 2584-2604, (2021); Sajjad, Aqsa, What Motivates Bitcoin Miners to Practice Bitcoin Mining: An Assessment Based on Behavioral Reasoning Theory, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 71, pp. 8209-8222, (2024); Shahsavari, Yahya, A Theoretical Model for Block Propagation Analysis in Bitcoin Network, IEEE Transactions on Engineering Management, 69, 4, pp. 1459-1476, (2022)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","","","","","15580040; 00189391","","IEEMA","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001396919"

This study investigates the long-memory characteristics of NFT returns and volatility, focusing on their potential for predicting price movements. As NFTs do not conform to traditional models, understanding their unique features is crucial for comprehending complex market dynamics. This study aims to reveal the impact of macroeconomic factors on NFT prices, understand their correlation and develop predictive models using autoregression and artificial intelligence (AI) technology. This research utilized datasets from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Christie’s, Dune, and Google Trends. Correlation and p value tests revealed strong relationships between NFT prices and variables such as weekly volume, pandemics, inflation and security. The Baseline Model using autoregression with NFT volume, security and technology factors outperformed all other models demonstrating the speculative volatility of NFTs. The Transformer Model using transformers, an architecture used by ChatGPT, Gemini and Stable Diffusion, showed high accuracy with less feature selection and preprocessing efforts. This study provides a novelty using a systematic approach for researchers to perform financial forecasting and contributes to the scarce literature on NFTs. This research offers valuable insights to investors and private agents regarding the right economic conditions for NFT investments by reducing portfolio risks and making informed decisions. To the authors’ best knowledge, this is the first study to utilize time-series transformers for forecasting NFTs based on macroeconomic factors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Intelligence; artificial intelligence; Econometrics; Finance; Financial Management; fintech; Macroeconomics; macroeconomics; NFTs; prediction; Risk Management; Technology; time series; transformer","","","","","Aharon, David Yechiam, NFTs and asset class spillovers: Lessons from the period around the COVID-19 pandemic, Finance Research Letters, 47, (2022); Ahmed, Sabeen, Transformers in Time-Series Analysis: A Tutorial, Circuits, Systems, and Signal Processing, 42, 12, pp. 7433-7466, (2023); Asian Journal of Technology Management Ajtm, (2023); Alam, Masud, Volatility spillover and connectedness among REITs, NFTs, cryptocurrencies and other assets: Portfolio implications, Investment Analysts Journal, 52, 2, pp. 83-105, (2023); ALON, Ilan, Predictors of NFT Prices: An Automated Machine Learning Approach, Journal of Global Information Management, 31, 1, (2023); An, Jaehyung, Relationship between the popularity of a platform and the price of NFT assets, Finance Research Letters, 61, (2024); Ante, Lennart, The Non-Fungible Token (NFT) Market and Its Relationship with Bitcoin and Ethereum, FinTech, 1, 3, pp. 216-224, (2022); Apostu, Simona Andreea, NFTs and Cryptocurrencies—The Metamorphosis of the Economy under the Sign of Blockchain: A Time Series Approach, Mathematics, 10, 17, (2022); Cho, Ej, Characterizing the Initial and Subsequent NFT Sales Market Dynamics: Perspectives from Boom and Slump Periods, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 3638-3658, (2024); Arts, (2023)","","Cogent OA","","","","","","23322039","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-105000439857"

Blockchain technologies, automated financial planning and investment advice services, and risk scoring and fraud detection tools can be leveraged in financial trading forecasting and planning, cryptocurrency transactions, and financial work-flow automation and fraud detection. Algorithmic trading and fraud detection tools, distributed ledger and cryptocurrency technologies, and ensemble learning and support vector machine algorithms are pivotal in predictive analytics-based risk mitigation, customer behavior and preference-based financial product and service personalization, and financial transaction and fraud detection automation. Credit scoring and risk management tools can offer financial personalized recommendations based on customer data, behavior, and preferences, in addition to transaction history, by generative adversarial and deep learning recurrent neu-ral networks. Purpose of the article: We show that blockchain and edge computing technologies, generative artificial IoT-based fintech algorithms, and transaction monitoring and credit scoring tools can be harnessed in financial decision-making processes and loan default rate mitigation for transaction, payment, and credit process efficiency. Generative and predictive artificial intelligence (AI) algorithmic trading systems can drive coherent customer service operations, provide tailored financial and investment advice, and influence financial decision processing, while performing real-time risk assessment and financial and trading risk scenario simulation across fluctuating market conditions. Fraud and money laundering prevention tools, block-chain and financial transaction technologies, and federated and decentralized machine learning algorithms can articulate algorithmic profiling-based transaction data patterns and structures, credit assessment, loan repaying likelihood prediction, and interest rate and credit lending risk management by real-time financial pattern and economic forecast-based credit analysis across investment payment and transaction record infrastructures. Methods: Research published between 2023 and 2024 was identified and analyzed across ProQuest, Scopus, and the Web of Science databases by use of screening and quality assessment software systems such as Abstrackr, AMSTAR, AXIS, CADIMA, CASP, Catchii, Distill-erSR, Eppi-Reviewer, MMAT, Nested Knowledge, PICO Portal, Rayyan, ROBIS, and SRDR+. Findings & value added: The main value added derived from the systematic literature review is that generative AI-based operational risk management, fraud detection, and transaction monitoring tools can provide personalized financial support and services and clarify financial and credit decisions and operations by financial decision-making process automation in dynamic business environments based on fraud detection capabilities and transaction data analysis and assessment. The benefits for theory and current state of the art are that credit risk and financial forecasting tools, artificial IoT-based fintech and generative AI algorithms, and algorithmic trading and distributed ledger technologies can be deployed in financial decision-making and customer behavior pattern optimization, credit score assessment, and money laundering and fraudulent payment detection. Policy implications reveal that investment management and algorithmic credit scoring tools can streamline financial activity operational efficiency, design financial planning analysis and forecasting, and carry out financial service and transaction data analysis for informed transaction decision-making and fraudulent behavior pattern and incident detection, taking into account credit history and risk evaluation and improving personalized experiences. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","algorithmic trading; blockchain; fintech; fraud detection; generative artificial intelligence; Internet of Things","","","","This research was financially supported by the Slovak Research and Development Agency Grant VEGA 1/0677/22: Quo Vadis, Bankruptcy Models?

In our co-occurrence analysis, we focus on companies that share the same emotion on the same day, using a much shorter horizon than our previous study of one month. This approach allows us to uncover short-term, emotion-driven correlations that traditional models might overlook. By analyzing these co-occurrence networks, Fin-ALICE identifies hidden connections between companies, sectors, and events. Supply chain analysis within Fin-ALICE will evaluate significant events in commodity-producing countries that impact their ability to supply key resources. This analysis captures the ripple effects of disruptions across industries and regions, offering a more nuanced prediction of market movements. Emotional sentiment analysis, powered by the Fin-Emotion library developed in our prior research, quantifies the emotional undertones in financial news through metrics like “emotion magnitude” and “emotion interaction”. These insights, when integrated with Temporal Convolutional Networks (TCNs), significantly enhance the accuracy of financial forecasts by capturing the emotional drivers of market sentiment. Key contributions of Fin-ALICE include its ability to perform month-by-month company correlation analysis, capturing short-term market fluctuations and seasonal patterns. We compare the performance of TCNs against advanced models such as LLMs and LSTMs, demonstrating that the Fin-ALICE model outperforms these models, particularly in sectors where emotional sentiment and supply chain dynamics are critical. Fin-ALICE provides decision-makers with predictive insights and a deeper understanding of the underlying emotional and supply chain factors that drive market behaviors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","emotion interaction; financial market analysis; large language models; sentiment analysis; supply chain; temporal convolutional networks; time series forecasting","","","","","Fingpt Fingpt Fingpt Forecaster at Master Github, (2024); Finbert Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre Trained Language Models, (2019); Arxiv, (2023); Cen, Yuefeng, Financial Market Correlation Analysis and Stock Selection Application Based on TCN-Deep Clustering, Future Internet, 14, 11, (2022); Chong, Eunsuk, Deep learning networks for stock market analysis and prediction: Methodology, data representations, and case studies, Expert Systems with Applications, 83, pp. 187-205, (2017); Correia, Filipe Figueiredo, Deep Neural Networks Applied to Stock Market Sentiment Analysis, Sensors, 22, 12, (2022); Dai, Wei, Price change prediction of Ultra high frequency financial data based on temporal convolutional network, Procedia Computer Science, 199, pp. 1177-1183, (2021); Demszky, Dorottya, GoEmotions: A dataset of fine-grained emotions, Proceedings of the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics, pp. 4040-4054, (2020); Guo, Sing, Stock Movement Prediction via Temporal Convolutional Network and Interactive Attention Network, pp. 413-417, (2023); Guo, Wenchao, Stock price forecasting based on improved time convolution network, Computational Intelligence, 38, 4, pp. 1474-1491, (2022)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","19118074","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85213433591"

Meanwhile, existing AI-driven approaches, while powerful in processing large datasets, often lack interpretability due to their black-box nature. This paper presents ElliottAgents, a multi-agent system that combines the Elliott wave principle with LLMs, showcasing the application of deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and natural language processing (NLP) in financial analysis. By integrating retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and deep reinforcement learning (DRL), the system processes vast amounts of market data to identify Elliott wave patterns and generate actionable insights. The system employs a coordinated team of specialized agents, each responsible for specific aspects of analysis, from pattern recognition to investment strategy formulation. We tested ElliottAgents on both stock and cryptocurrency markets, evaluating its effectiveness in pattern identification and trend prediction across different time scales. Our experimental results demonstrate improvements in prediction accuracy when combining classical technical analysis with AI-driven approaches, particularly when enhanced by DRL-based backtesting process.

This is especially true in medical research, where identifying unknown cancer mechanisms and their impact on phenomena like drug resistance is vital. Directly observing these mechanisms is challenging due to measurement complexities, leading to an approach that infers latent mechanisms from observed variable distributions. Despite machine learning advancements enabling sophisticated generative models, their black-box nature complicates the interpretation of complex latent mechanisms. A promising method for understanding these mechanisms involves estimating latent factors through linear projection, though there’s no assurance that inferences made under specific conditions will remain valid across contexts. We propose a novel solution, suggesting data, even from systems appearing complex, can often be explained by sparse dependencies among a few common latent factors, regardless of the situation. This simplification allows for modeling that yields significant insights across diverse fields.

However, backtesting such strategies poses a challenge because LLMs are trained on many years of data, and backtesting produces biased results if the training and backtesting periods overlap. This bias can take two forms: a look-ahead bias, in which the LLM may have specific knowledge of the stock returns that followed a news article, and a distraction effect, in which general knowledge of the companies named interferes with the measurement of a text’s sentiment. The authors investigate these sources of bias through trading strategies driven by the sentiment of financial news headlines. They compare trading performance based on the original headlines with debiased strategies in which they remove the relevant company’s identifiers from the text. In-sample (within the LLM training window), the authors find, surprisingly, that the anonymized headlines outperform, indicating that the distraction effect has a greater impact than look-ahead bias. This tendency is particularly strong for larger companies—companies about which the authors expect an LLM to have greater general knowledge. Out-of-sample, look-ahead bias is not a concern but distraction remains possible. The authors’ proposed anonymization procedure is therefore potentially useful in out-of-sample implementation, as well as for debiased backtesting. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","","","","","Calomiris, Charles W., How news and its context drive risk and returns around the world, Journal of Financial Economics, 133, 2, pp. 299-336, (2019); Carlini, Nicholas, Extracting training data from large language models, pp. 2633-2650, (2021); Chatgpt Informed Graph Neural Network for Stock Movement Prediction, (2023); Das, Sanjiv Ranjan, Yahoo! for amazon: Sentiment extraction from small talk on the Web, Management Science, 53, 9, pp. 1375-1388, (2007); U S Research Returns Data Data Library, (2018); García, Diego, The colour of finance words, Journal of Financial Economics, 147, 3, pp. 525-549, (2023); Glasserman, Paul, Time Variation in the News-Returns Relationship, Journal of Financial and Quantitative Analysis, 60, 1, pp. 258-294, (2025); Can Chatgpt Decipher Fedspeak, (2023); Predicting Returns with Text Data, (2025); Can Chatgpt Forecast Stock Price Movements Return Predictability and Large Language Models, (2023)","","With intelligence","","","","","","26403943; 26403951","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184706164"

By leveraging the forward and reverse processes of a conditional diffusion model to add and remove noise progressively, we reconstruct original data from noisy inputs. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that diffusion model-based denoised time series significantly enhance the performance on downstream future return classification tasks.

While previous studies have used multimodal deep learning-based models to obtain a general view of ECCs for volatility predicting, they often fail to capture detailed, complex information. Our research introduces a novel framework: ECC Analyzer, which utilizes large language models (LLMs) to extract richer, more predictive content from ECCs to aid the model's prediction performance. We use the pre-trained large models to extract textual and audio features from ECCs and implement a hierarchical information extraction strategy to extract more fine-grained information. This strategy first extracts paragraph-level general information by summarizing the text and then extracts fine-grained focus sentences using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). These features are then fused through multimodal feature fusion to perform volatility prediction. Experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms traditional analytical benchmarks, confirming the effectiveness of advanced LLM techniques in financial analysis. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Earnings Conference Call Analysis; Large Language Model; Retrieval-Augmented Generation; Volatility forecasting","Prediction models; Critical challenges; Earning conference call analyze; Fine grained; Language model; Large language model; Learning Based Models; Multi-modal; Retrieval-augmented generation; Unstructured data; Volatility forecasting; Deep learning","","","","Proceedings of the Third Workshop on Financial Technology and Natural Language Processing, (2021); Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, (2020); Bollen, Johan, Twitter mood predicts the stock market, Journal of Computational Science, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Empirical Evaluation of Gated Recurrent Neural Networks on Sequence Modeling, (2014); Cox, John C., The valuation of options for alternative stochastic processes, Journal of Financial Economics, 3, 1-2, pp. 145-166, (1976); Cramer, Jason, Look, Listen, and Learn More: Design Choices for Deep Audio Embeddings, Proceedings - ICASSP, IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing, 2019-May, pp. 3852-3856, (2019); Ding, Xiao, Deep learning for event-driven stock prediction, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2015-January, pp. 2327-2333, (2015); Dumas, Bernard, Equilibrium portfolio strategies in the presence of sentiment risk and excess volatility, Journal of Finance, 64, 2, pp. 579-629, (2009); Accounting Review, (1984); Franses, Philip Hans, Forecasting stock market volatility using (non-linear) Garch models, Journal of Forecasting, 15, 3, pp. 229-235, (1996)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","5th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance, ICAIF 2024","","Brooklyn; NY","205273","","9798400710810","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214883095"

Traditional deep learning and reinforcement learning methods require large training data and often involve encoding various data types into numerical formats for model input, which limits the explainability of model behavior. Recently, LLM-based agents have demonstrated remarkable advancements in handling multi-modal data, enabling them to execute complex, multi-step decision-making tasks while providing insights into their thought processes. This research introduces a multi-modal multi-agent system designed specifically for financial trading tasks. Our framework employs a team of specialized LLM-based agents, each adept at processing and interpreting various forms of financial data, such as textual news reports, candlestick charts, and trading signal charts. A key feature of our approach is the integration of a reflection module, which conducts analyses of historical trading signals and their outcomes. This reflective process is instrumental in enhancing the decision-making capabilities of the system for future trading scenarios. Furthermore, the ablation studies indicate that the visual reflection module plays a crucial role in enhancing the decision-making capabilities of our framework. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Large Language Models; Multi-Agent Framework","Deep learning; Deep reinforcement learning; Electronic trading; Marketplaces; Modula (programming language); Network security; Datatypes; Decisions makings; Encodings; Financial trading; Language model; Large language model; Multiagent framework; Reinforcement learning method; Stock market prediction; Training data; Reinforcement learning","","","","Sparks of Artificial General Intelligence Early Experiments with Gpt 4, (2023); Bybee, Leland, Narrative Asset Pricing: Interpretable Systematic Risk Factors from News Text, Review of Financial Studies, 36, 12, pp. 4759-4787, (2023); Chang, Yupeng, A Survey on Evaluation of Large Language Models, ACM Transactions on Intelligent Systems and Technology, 15, 3, (2024); Reconcile Round Table Conference Improves Reasoning Via Consensus Among Diverse Llms, (2023); Training Verifiers to Solve Math Word Problems, (2021); Improving Factuality and Reasoning in Language Models Through Multiagent Debate, (2023); Multi Agent Software Development Through Cross Team Collaboration, (2024); Visual Reasoning and Multi Agent Approach in Multimodal Large Language Models Mllms Solving Tsp and Mtsp Combinatorial Challenges, (2024); Critic Large Language Models can Self Correct with Tool Interactive Critiquing, (2023); Han, Weiguang, Select and Trade: Towards Unified Pair Trading with Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 4123-4134, (2023)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","5th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance, ICAIF 2024","","Brooklyn; NY","205273","","9798400710810","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214878138"

These accomplishments have also led to increased interest in other network architectures that rely on attention mechanisms, one of the building blocks of transformers. Transformers and other attention-based networks are being applied to the quantitative analysis, management, and trading of financial assets, be it for price movement prediction, discovery of trading strategies, portfolio optimization, and risk management. The applications range across different asset categories, including equity markets, foreign exchange pairs, cryptocurrencies, and futures markets. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the applications of attention-based networks within the field of quantitative analysis, management, and trading of financial assets. After a brief overview of transformers and attention mechanisms, we analyze the existing applications of these architectures for quantitative finance in a taxonomy of four specializations: Alpha Seeking, Risk Management, Portfolio Construction, and Execution.

Fundamentally, the goal of classical factor modeling is statistical modeling of stock returns, and in this work, we explore using deep generative modeling to enhance classical factor models. Prior work has explored the use of deep generative models in order to model hundreds of stocks, leading to accurate risk forecasting and alpha portfolio construction; however, that specific model does not allow for easy factor modeling interpretation in that the factor exposures cannot be deduced. In this work, we introduce NeuralFactors, a novel machine-learning based approach to factor analysis where a neural network outputs factor exposures and factor returns, trained using the same methodology as variational autoencoders. We show that this model outperforms prior approaches both in terms of log-likelihood performance and computational efficiency. Further, we show that this method is competitive to prior work in generating realistic synthetic data, covariance estimation, risk analysis (e.g., value at risk, or VaR, of portfolios), and portfolio optimization. Finally, due to the connection to classical factor analysis, we analyze how the factors our model learns cluster together and show that the factor exposures could be used for embedding stocks. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Generative Modeling; Portfolio Optimization; Risk Forecasting; Statistical Factors; Stock Returns; Variational Autoencoders","Adversarial machine learning; Contrastive Learning; Auto encoders; Factor model; Generative model; Machine-learning; Portfolio optimization; Risk forecasting; Statistic modeling; Statistical factor; Stock returns; Variational autoencoder; Generative adversarial networks","","","","Journal of Business, (1997); Xlstm Extended Long Short Term Memory, (2024); Box, George E.P., A general distribution theory for a class of likelihood criteria., Biometrika, 36, 3-4, pp. 317-346, (1949); A Data Driven Market Simulator for Small Data Environments, (2020); Burda, Yuri, Importance weighted autoencoders, (2016); Tail Gan Learning to Simulate Tail Risk Scenarios, (2022); Econometrica, (1987); Github, (2019); Fama, Eugene F., A five-factor asset pricing model, Journal of Financial Economics, 116, 1, pp. 1-22, (2015); Factor Analysis Probabilistic Principal Component Analysis Variational Inference and Variational Autoencoder Tutorial and Survey, (2021)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","","5th ACM International Conference on AI in Finance, ICAIF 2024","","Brooklyn; NY","205273","","9798400710810","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85214872254"

Business news as an important source of market information is often exploited by artificial intelligence–based volatility forecasting models.

Meanwhile, understanding the inner workings of deep neural networks is challenging because of the largely black box nature of large neural networks. In this work, we address the first challenge by proposing a long- and short-term memory retrieval (LASER) architecture with flexible memory and horizon configurations to forecast market volatility. Then, we tackle the interpretability issue by devising a BEAM algorithm that leverages a large pretrained language model (GPT-2).

Traditionally, these predictions have focused on the statistical analysis of quantitative factors, such as stock prices, trading volumes, inflation rates, and changes in industrial production. Recent advancements in large language models motivate the integrated financial analysis of both sentiment data, particularly market news, and numerical factors. Nonetheless, this methodology frequently encounters constraints due to the paucity of extensive datasets that amalgamate both quantitative and qualitative sentiment analyses. To address this challenge, we introduce a large-scale financial dataset, namely, Financial News and Stock Price Integration Dataset (FNSPID). It comprises 29.7 million stock prices and 15.7 million time-aligned financial news records for 4,775 S&P500 companies, covering the period from 1999 to 2023, sourced from 4 stock market news websites. We demonstrate that FNSPID excels existing stock market datasets in scale and diversity while uniquely incorporating sentiment information. Through financial analysis experiments on FNSPID, we propose: (1) the dataset's size and quality significantly boost market prediction accuracy; (2) adding sentiment scores modestly enhances performance on the transformer-based model; (3) a reproducible procedure that can update the dataset. Completed work, code, documentation, and examples are available at this http URL.

Stock market sentiment analysis is useful for understanding investor sentiments and forecasting market moves. Market players can use sentiment analysis tools to evaluate market sentiment and make educated investing decisions. The previous study examined data with fewer than ten thousand rows; however, this research will work with very huge data sets of more than one hundred thousand Nasdaq companies acquired from @Nasdaq and @AppleSupport Twitter accounts and @nasdaq and @apple from subreddit in Reddit social media. This study will compare the classification accuracy of Naive Bayes and SVM, as well as the time consumption of each strategy while classifying vast quantities of data. The TextBlob NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) will be used in this study to label each phrase in the data using a lexicon-based method; also, this effort will employ ChatGPT, an OpenAI chatbot, to label each row of data received.

Recently, some GAN-based stock prediction models are proposed, where LSTM or GRU is used as the generator. However, these generators lack the function of feature extraction, and the prediction accuracies are slightly low. Meanwhile, these models choose some simple volume-price factors (such as OCHLV and OCHLVC) as inputs, without considering the impact of other factors on stock prices. In order to solve these problems, a stock prediction method based on multiple factors and GAN-TrellisNet is proposed. Instead of “OCHLV” or ”OCHLVC,” a multi-factor strategy with ”alpha158+OCHLVC” is introduced to enrich the stock data of inputs. The proposed generative adversarial network (GAN) is a combination of two neural networks which are TrellisNet as generative model and convolutional neural network (CNN) as discriminative model for adversarial training to forecast the stock market. TrellisNet, which integrates the feature extraction capabilities of CNN and the temporal processing capabilities of recurrent neural network (RNN), will generate new predicted results based on historical data, and then CNN will distinguish between predicted results and real stock prices. In order to demonstrate the performance of our method, we selected the decade data of different stocks from four markets (A-shares, U.S. stocks, U.K. stocks and Hong Kong stocks) as dataset and conducted two groups of comparative experiments. Compared with the state-of-the-art methods based on GAN, our method has better performance in terms of MSE, MAE, RMSE and MAPE. In addition, the multi-factor strategy with “alpha158+OCHLVC” is more effective than the original strategy with OCHLVC factors. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Alpha158; CNN; GAN; Multi-factor strategy; OCHLVC; Stock price prediction; TrellisNet","Commerce; Convolutional neural networks; Costs; Extraction; Feature extraction; Financial markets; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Alpha158; Convolutional neural network; Multi-factor; Multi-factor strategy; Neural-networks; OCHLVC; Stock predictions; Stock price; Stock price prediction; Trellisnet; Generative adversarial networks","","","This work is supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (62071240), the Innovation Program for Quantum Science and Technology (2021ZD0302901), the Natural Science Foundation of Jiangsu Province (BK20231142 and BK20220804) and the Priority Academic Program Development of Jiangsu Higher Education Institutions (PAPD).","Binkowski, Mikołaj, Autoregressive convolutional neural networks for asynchronous time series, 2, pp. 933-945, (2018); Stock Price Prediction Using Machine Learning and Lstm Based Deep Learning Models, (2020); Karasu, Seckin, A new forecasting model with wrapper-based feature selection approach using multi-objective optimization technique for chaotic crude oil time series, Energy, 212, (2020); Altan, Aytaç, Crude oil time series prediction model based on LSTM network with chaotic Henry gas solubility optimization, Energy, 242, (2022); Altan, Aytaç, Digital currency forecasting with chaotic meta-heuristic bio-inspired signal processing techniques, Chaos, Solitons and Fractals, 126, pp. 325-336, (2019); Ab Rahman, Asyraf Safwan, Mining textual terms for stock market prediction analysis using financial news, Communications in Computer and Information Science, 788, pp. 293-305, (2017); Preprint at Arxiv, (2020); Sen, Jaydip, Profitability analysis in stock investment using an LSTM-based deep learning model, (2021); International Journal of Science and Research Ijsr, (2017); Qiu, Jiayu, Forecasting stock prices with long-short term memory neural network based on attention mechanism, PLOS ONE, 15, 1, (2020)","","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","","","","","02193116; 02191377","","","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188430896"

In this study we demonstrate that emotion analysis of financial news headlines alone can be sufficient in predicting stock price movement, even in the absence of any financial data. We propose an approach that eliminates the need for web scraping of financial data. We use API based mechanism to retrieve financial news headlines. In this study we train and subsequently leverage light and computationally fast Distilled LLM Model to gather emotional tone and strength of financial news headlines for companies. We then use this information with several machine learning-based classification algorithms to predict the stock price direction based solely on the emotion analysis of news.

However, a few studies have been reported based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) in this area, but their results are promising. While GANs are powerful generative models successfully applied in different areas, they suffer from inherent challenges such as training instability and mode collapse. Another primary concern is capturing correlations in stock prices. Therefore, the main challenges fall into two categories: capturing correlations and addressing the inherent problems of GANs. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework based on DRAGAN and feature matching for stock price forecasting, which improves training stability and alleviates mode collapse. We employ windowing to acquire temporal correlations by the generator and exploit conditioning on discriminator inputs to capture temporal correlations and correlations between prices and features. Experimental results on data from several stocks indicate that proposed method outperforms long short-term memory (LSTM) as a baseline method, as well as basic GANs and WGAN-GP as two different variants of GANs. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature matching; Generative Adversarial Networks; Stock price prediction; Time series forecasting","Costs; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Long short-term memory; Baseline methods; Features matching; Generative model; Machine learning methods; Stock market forecasting; Stock price; Stock price forecasting; Stock price prediction; Temporal correlations; Time series forecasting; Generative adversarial networks","","","","Areekul, Phatchakorn, Notice of Removal: A hybrid ARIMA and neural network model for short-term price forecasting in deregulated market, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 25, 1, pp. 524-530, (2010); undefined, (2017); Icml, (2017); Basak, Suryoday, Predicting the direction of stock market prices using tree-based classifiers, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 47, pp. 552-567, (2019); Bhuriya, Dinesh, Stock market predication using a linear regression, 2017-January, pp. 510-513, (2017); Time Series Analysis Forecasting and Control, (1976); Bustos, Oscar, Stock market movement forecast: A Systematic review, Expert Systems with Applications, 156, (2020); Cao, Hongduo, Stock Price Pattern Prediction Based on Complex Network and Machine Learning, Complexity, 2019, (2019); Cao, Jiasheng, Stock price forecasting model based on modified convolution neural network and financial time series analysis, International Journal of Communication Systems, 32, 12, (2019); Chen, Shun, Exploring the attention mechanism in LSTM-based Hong Kong stock price movement prediction, Quantitative Finance, 19, 9, pp. 1507-1515, (2019)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85180533685"

By translating emojis into quantifiable sentiment data, we correlate these insights with key market indicators such as BTC Price and the VCRIX index. Our architecture's analysis of emoji sentiment demonstrated a distinct advantage over FinBERT's pure text sentiment analysis in such predicting power. This approach may be fed into the development of trading strategies aimed at utilizing social media elements to identify and forecast market trends.

Today, Large Language Models (LLMs) present a solution to this problem, given their known capabilities to generate human-readable explanations for their decision-making process. However, the task of stock prediction remains challenging for LLMs, as it requires the ability to weigh the varying impacts of chaotic social texts on stock prices. The problem gets progressively harder with the introduction of the explanation component, which requires LLMs to explain verbally why certain factors are more important than the others. On the other hand, to fine-tune LLMs for such a task, one would need expert-annotated samples of explanation for every stock movement in the training set, which is expensive and impractical to scale. To tackle these issues, we propose our Summarize-Explain-Predict (SEP) framework, which utilizes a verbal self-reflective agent and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) that allow a LLM teach itself how to generate explainable stock predictions, in a fully autonomous manner. The reflective agent learns how to explain past stock movements through a self-reasoning process, while the PPO trainer trains the model to generate the most likely explanations given the input texts at test-time. The training samples for the PPO trainer are also the responses generated during the reflective process, which eliminates the need for human annotators. Using our SEP framework, we fine-tune a specialized LLM that can outperform both traditional deep-learning and LLM methods in prediction accuracy and Matthews correlation coefficient, for the stock classification task. To justify the generalization capability of our framework, we further test it on the portfolio construction task, and demonstrate its effectiveness through various portfolio metrics.

In 2021, the global data center industry was responsible for around 1% of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. With more resource-intensive workloads, such as Large Language Models, gaining popularity, this percentage is expected to increase further. Therefore, it is crucial for data center service providers to become aware of and accountable for the sustainability impact of their design and operational choices. However, reducing the carbon footprint of data centers has been a challenging process due to the lack of comprehensive metrics, carbon-aware design tools, and guidelines for carbon-aware optimization. In this work, we propose FootPrinter, a first-of-its-kind tool that supports data center designers and operators in assessing the environmental impact of their data center. FootPrinter uses coarse-grained operational data, grid energy mix information, and discrete event simulation to determine the data center's operational carbon footprint and evaluate the impact of infrastructural or operational changes. FootPrinter can simulate days of operations of a regional data center on a commodity laptop in a few seconds, returning the estimated footprint with marginal error. By making this project open source, we hope to engage the community in the development of methodologies and tools for systematically assessing and exploring the sustainability of data centers. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","carbon emission; carbon footprint; data center; simulation","Discrete event simulation; Emission control; Gas emissions; Greenhouse gases; Sustainable development; Carbon emissions; Data center services; Datacenter; Global data; Greenhouse gas emissions; Language model; Operational choice; Service provider; Simulation; Sustainability impacts; Carbon footprint","","","This work is supported by EU Horizon Graph Massivizer (g.a. 101093202) and EU MSCA CloudStars projects (g.a. 101086248).

Up until the end of July 2023, more than 9100 research papers on cryptocurrencies were published and indexed in the Web of Science Clarivate platform. The objective of this paper is to analyze the impact of publications on Bitcoin prices. This study aims to uncover significant themes within these research articles, focusing on cryptocurrencies in general and Bitcoin specifically. The research employs latent Dirichlet allocation to identify key topics from the unstructured abstracts. To determine the optimal number of topics, perplexity and topic coherence metrics are calculated. Additionally, the abstracts are processed using BERT-transformers and Word2Vec and their potential to predict Bitcoin prices is assessed. Based on the results, while the research helps in understanding cryptocurrencies, the potential of academic publications to influence Bitcoin prices is not significant, demonstrating a weak connection. In other words, the movements of Bitcoin prices are not influenced by the scientific writing in this specific field. The primary topics emerging from the analysis are the blockchain, market dynamics, transactions, pricing trends, network security, and the mining process. These findings suggest that future research should pay closer attention to issues like the energy demands and environmental impacts of mining, anti-money laundering measures, and behavioral aspects related to cryptocurrencies. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bitcoin prices; cryptocurrency; latent Dirichlet allocation; research publication; sentiment analysis; topic modelling","","","","","Seow, Kiam Tian, Supervisory Control of Blockchain Networks, IEEE Transactions on Systems, Man, and Cybernetics: Systems, 50, 1, pp. 159-171, (2020); Parino, Francesco, Analysis of the Bitcoin blockchain: socio-economic factors behind the adoption, EPJ Data Science, 7, 1, (2018); Liu, Yulin, Deciphering Bitcoin Blockchain Data by Cohort Analysis, Scientific Data, 9, 1, (2022); Prybila, Christoph, Runtime verification for business processes utilizing the Bitcoin blockchain, Future Generation Computer Systems, 107, pp. 816-831, (2020); Dias, Rui Manuel, Clean Energy Stocks: Resilient Safe Havens in the Volatility of Dirty Cryptocurrencies, Energies, 16, 13, (2023); Sapra, Nishant, Impact of Bitcoin mining and crypto market determinants on Bitcoin-based energy consumption, Managerial Finance, 49, 11, pp. 1828-1846, (2023); Sharif, Arshian, Analysis of the spillover effects between green economy, clean and dirty cryptocurrencies, Energy Economics, 120, (2023); De Vries, Alex, Revisiting Bitcoin's carbon footprint, Joule, 6, 3, pp. 498-502, (2022); Zaghloul, Ehab, Bitcoin and Blockchain: Security and Privacy, IEEE Internet of Things Journal, 7, 10, pp. 10288-10313, (2020); Ba, Moustapha, The effect of propagation delay on the dynamic evolution of the Bitcoin blockchain, Digital Communications and Networks, 6, 2, pp. 157-166, (2020)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","07181876","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85188895880"

To achieve this, we propose a dynamic generative factor model which uses random variable transformation as an implicit way of distribution modeling and relies on the Attention-GRU network for dynamic learning and forecasting. The proposed model captures the dynamic dependence among multivariate stock returns, especially focusing on the tail-side properties. We also propose a two-step iterative algorithm to train the model and then predict the time-varying model parameters, including the time-invariant tail parameters. At each investment date, we can easily simulate new samples from the learned generative model, and we further perform CVaR portfolio optimization with the simulated samples to form a dynamic portfolio strategy.

However, their application in forecasting stock or commodity trading returns remains underexplored. In this study, we aim to compare the performance of three transformer-based models - Informer, Autoformer, and Transformer with Positional Encoder unit - alongside an LSTM for forecasting commodity returns. Specifically, the two datasets used will consist of historical commodity prices, including six types of metals. These models, known for their capacity to handle long sequence data, have shown promise in financial forecasting, particularly. Still, their potential in commodity trading price forecasting has been less studied. By evaluating these models based on historical metal prices, this research seeks to determine the most accurate model for predicting commodity returns, providing valuable insights for the commodity trading and financial sectors. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoformer; Commodity Trading; Encoder; Informer; Positional Embedding; Time series; Transformer","Commerce; Financial data processing; Autoformer; Commodities trading; Embeddings; Encoder; Informer; Natural languages; Positional embedding; Price forecasting; Times series; Transformer; Costs","","","","Adebiyi, Ayodele Ariyo, Stock price prediction using the ARIMA model, pp. 106-112, (2014); Neurocomputing, (2023); Forecasting Irish Inflation Using Arima Models, (1998); Sherstinsky, Alex S., Fundamentals of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, Physica D: Nonlinear Phenomena, 404, (2020); Attention is all You Need, (2023); Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting, (2022); Lim, Bryan, Temporal Fusion Transformers for interpretable multi-horizon time series forecasting, International Journal of Forecasting, 37, 4, pp. 1748-1764, (2021); International Journal of Forecasting, (2020); Contreras, Javier Mariano Paniagua, ARIMA models to predict next-day electricity prices, IEEE Transactions on Power Systems, 18, 3, pp. 1014-1020, (2003); Li, Chengyu, Stock Price Prediction Using a Frequency Decomposition Based GRU Transformer Neural Network, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 1, (2023)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","IEEE; IEEE Communications Society (ComSoc); International Society for Applied Computing (ISAC)","7th International Conference on Data Science and Information Technology, DSIT 2024","","Nanjing","207065","","9798350384093","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-86000232846"

Traditional option pricing models, such as the Black-Scholes equation, depend on simplifying assumptions and struggle to effectively capture complex market dynamics. The study investigates the viability of using the Generative Pretrained Transformer (GPT) model to assess the value of stock options. We fine-tune the state-of-the-art GPT-3.5-turbo model by utilizing past option chain data and evaluate its precision in predicting option prices for well-known technology stocks including Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG), and Microsoft (MSFT). Our model employs many features, including strike price, underlying price, days to expiry, and volatility index (VIX), to precisely predict option prices. Extensive examination undertaken at various degrees of moneyness and time horizons demonstrates that GPT models consistently surpass Black-Scholes in terms of both mean absolute error and root mean squared error. Out of all the models that were assessed, the 5-year data models exhibit the greatest overall accuracy. An error study suggests that pricing for options at the money has improved, but there are issues in appropriately pricing options that are highly in the money or out of the money. The GPT technique shows promise in leveraging transformers for computational finance applications. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Black-Scholes Model; Finance Applications; Generative Pre-trained Transformer; Machine Learning; Options; Pricing; Stocks; Volatility","Commerce; Costs; Decentralized finance; Financial markets; Black-Scholes model; Finance application; Generative pre-trained transformer; Machine-learning; Option; Option price; Stock; Time frame; Transformer modeling; Volatility; Mean square error","","","","Hall, Brian J., What you need to know about stock options, Harvard Business Review, 78, 2, pp. 121-129, (2000); Journal of Management Research, (2013); Goncalves-Pinto, Luis, Why do option prices predict stock returns?

The Assystem, complementing smart wearables, utilizes AI Assistance, with forward facing conversational chatbot interface thus creating a natural environment for the users. This AI-enabled assistant provides customized suggestions, up-to-the-minute details, and impeccable representative behavior as it syncs to investors' expectations. Finally, the Market Guider feature offers users the news and updates from the stock market which were curated, enabling them to stay updated with the involved changes.

It achieved an R-squared score of 0.89, indicating strong predictive power, and demonstrated robustness with a cross-validation score of 0.84 on both training and testing datasets. The model was serialized into a Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) file to save runtime operations and facilitate deployment in Streamlit.

However, many of these time series data in Financial Aid (FA) pose unique challenges due to limited historical datasets and high dimensional financial information, which hinder the development of effective predictive models that balance accuracy with efficient runtime and memory usage. Pre-trained foundation models are employed to address these challenging tasks. We use state-of-the-art time series models including pre-trained LLMs (GPT-2 as backbone), transformers, and linear models to demonstrate their ability to outperform traditional approaches, even with minimal (""few-shot"") or no fine-tuning (""zero-shot"").

To achieve a better accuracy in sentiment classification, experiments are designed to compare six different models (GPT 4, Llama 3, Gemma 2, Mistral 7b, FinBERT, VADER) in financial news sentiment classification, and it was found that recent large language models can outperform FinBERT and VADER, which are the most commonly used models in financial sentiment analysis. Based on the experiment results, Llama 3, with relatively stable performance, is chosen to classify the news sentiments of the selected companies. Informer, Transformer, TCN, LSTM, SVR, Random Forest and Naive Forecast are used to predict the stock prices with different sliding window sizes. Experiments with different scenarios are designed to evaluate the prediction ability of news sentiment. Results show that adding news sentiment data can indeed improve the stock price prediction. Informer, one of the state-of-the-art transformer models for long-term prediction tasks, yields the best performances in most cases.

We assume that financial reports (such as income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements), historical price data, and recent news articles can collectively represent aforementioned factors.We combine financial data in tabular format with textual news articles and employ pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict market movements. Recent research in LLMs has demonstrated that they are able to perform both tabular and text classification tasks, making them our primary model to classify the multi-modal data. We utilize retrieval augmentation techniques to retrieve and attach relevant chunks of news articles to financial metrics related to a company and prompt the LLMs in zero, two, and four-shot settings. Our dataset contains news articles collected from different sources, historic stock price, and financial report data for 20 companies with the highest trading volume across different industries in the stock market. We utilized recently released language models for our LLM-based classifier, including GPT- 3 and 4, and LLaMA- 2 and 3 models.We introduce an LLM-based classifier capable of performing classification tasks using combination of tabular (structured) and textual (unstructured) data.

While traditional BERT-based methods have shown limited success, large language models (LLMs) have brought new possibilities. It is promising to leverage their remarkable comprehension ability to understand textual queries. However, implementing LLMs is non-trivial for two main reasons. Firstly, real-world EMTC datasets can be extremely large, with candidate product pairs reaching up to ten million in real-world scenarios, which poses significant challenges in data ingestion. Secondly, the large size of LLMs makes computation and memory demands prohibitive for EMTC applications. To this end, we propose QUEST, a Quantized and Efficient Learning with Sampling Technique. QUEST includes a tailored hash sampling module that reduces the data volume to one-fourth of its original size. Additionally, we perform compressive fine-tuning LLMs with only twenty thousand trainable parameters, largely reducing computational requirements. Extensive experiments demonstrate that QUEST outperforms existing methods while requiring fewer computational resources, unlocking efficient EMTC on commodity hardware such as a single Nvidia RTX 3090 GPU with 24 GB of memory. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Computer graphics equipment; Digital storage; Metadata; Modeling languages; Query languages; Query processing; Structured Query Language; Classification datasets; Commodity hardware; Data ingestions; Language model; Multi-label text classification; Multiple labels; Non-trivial; Real-world; Real-world scenario; Textual query; Computational linguistics","","","","Andoni, Alexandr, Beyond locality-sensitive hashing, Proceedings of the Annual ACM-SIAM Symposium on Discrete Algorithms, pp. 1018-1028, (2014); Andoni, Alexandr, Optimal hashing-based time-space trade-offs for approximate near neighbors, 0, pp. 47-66, (2017); Andoni, Alexandr, Optimal data-dependent hashing for approximate near neighbors, Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, 14-17-June-2015, pp. 793-801, (2015); Extreme Classification Repository Multi Label Datasets and Code, (2016); Bhatia, Kush, Sparse local embeddings for extreme multi-label classification, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2015-January, pp. 730-738, (2015); Broder, Andrei Z., On the resemblance and containment of documents, pp. 21-29, (1997); Broder, Andrei Z., Min-wise independent permutations, Conference Proceedings of the Annual ACM Symposium on Theory of Computing, pp. 327-336, (1998); An Empirical Study on Large Scale Multi Label Text Classification Including Few and Zero Shot Labels, (2020); Chang, Weicheng, Extreme Multi-label Learning for Semantic Matching in Product Search, pp. 2643-2651, (2021); Entity Alignment with Noisy Annotations from Large Language Models, (2024)","Al-Onaizan, Y.; Bansal, M.; Chen, Y.-N.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","Apple; Bloomberg; Citadel Securities; et al.; Google DeepMind; Meta","2024 Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics, EMNLP 2024","","Hybrid, Miami; FL","205885","","9798891761681","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85217621152"

This paper explores fine-tuning LLMs for predicting stock returns with financial newsflow. Return prediction is fundamental for quantitative investing tasks like portfolio construction and optimization. We formulate the model to include a text representation and forecasting modules. We propose to compare the encoder-only and decoder-only LLMs, considering they generate text representations in distinct ways. The impact of these different representations on return forecasting remains an open question. Meanwhile, we compare two simple methods of integrating LLMs’ token-level representations into the forecasting module. The experiments on real investment universes reveal that: (1) aggregated representations from LLMs’ token-level embeddings generally produce return predictions that enhance the performance of long-only and long-short portfolios; (2) in the relatively large investment universe, the decoder LLMs-based prediction model leads to stronger portfolios, whereas in the small universes, there are no consistent winners; (3) return predictions derived from LLMs’ text representations are a strong signal for portfolio construction, outperforming conventional sentiment scores. These findings suggest the potential of LLM fine-tuning for enhancing return prediction-based portfolio construction. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Financial markets; Investments; Sales; Fine tuning; Language generation; Language model; Language understanding; Optimisations; Performance; SIMPLE method; Stock return predictions; Stock returns; Text representation; Prediction models","","","","Allen, David Edmund Edmund, Daily market news sentiment and stock prices, Applied Economics, 51, 30, pp. 3212-3235, (2019); Asset Management A Systematic Approach to Factor Investing, (2014); Finbert Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre Trained Language Models, (2019); Transformers Need Glasses Information Over Squashing in Language Tasks, (2024); Llm2vec Large Language Models are Secretly Powerful Text Encoders, (2024); Brown, Tom B., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020-December, (2020); Journal of Machine Learning Research, (2024); Devlin, Jacob, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, 1, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Ding, Ning, Parameter-efficient fine-tuning of large-scale pre-trained language models, Nature Machine Intelligence, 5, 3, pp. 220-235, (2023); Llama 3 Herd of Models, (2024)","Dernoncourt, F.; Preotiuc-Pietro, D.; Shimorina, A.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","","2024 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: Industry Track, EMNLP 2024","","Miami; FL","205881","","9798891761667","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85216806545"

However, in applying LLMs on long documents, semantic relations are not explicitly incorporated, and a full or arbitrarily sparse attention operation is employed. In recent years, progress has been made in Abstract Meaning Representation (AMR), which is a graph-based representation of text to preserve its semantic relations. Since AMR can represent semantic relationships at a deeper level, it can be beneficially utilized by graph neural networks (GNNs) for constructing effective document-level graph representations built upon LLM embeddings to predict target metrics in the financial domain. We propose FLAG: Financial Long document classification via AMR-based GNN, an AMR graph based framework to generate document-level embeddings for long financial document classification. We construct document-level graphs from sentence-level AMR graphs, endow them with specialized LLM word embeddings in the financial domain, apply a deep learning mechanism that utilizes a GNN, and examine the efficacy of our AMR-based approach in predicting labeled target data from long financial documents. Extensive experiments are conducted on a dataset of quarterly earnings calls transcripts of companies in various sectors of the economy, as well as on a corpus of more recent earnings calls of companies in the S&P 1500 Composite Index. We find that our AMR-based approach outperforms fine-tuning LLMs directly on text in predicting stock price movement trends at different time horizons in both datasets.

Answering this question empirically presents a methodological challenge. Leveraging recent advances in deep learning, we propose a method to uncover the value of contextual information learned from the (deep) interactions between numeric and narrative disclosures. We show that the contextualization of accounting numbers makes them substantially more informative in shaping beliefs about a firm's future, especially when numeric data are less reliable. In fact, the informational value of interactions dominates the direct informational value of the narrative context. We corroborate this finding by showing that stock markets and financial analysts incorporate the interactions between narrative and numeric information when making forecasts. We also demonstrate the value of our approach by identifying rich firm-year–specific heterogeneity in earnings persistence. We discuss a number of avenues for future research. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","cash flows; deep learning; earnings; earnings persistence; heterogeneity; LLMs; MD&A; narrative context; neural networks","","","","","Are Words Beneficial to the Consumption of Numbers in Financial Reports, (2022); Contextualization of Numbers in Earnings Conference Calls, (2023); Finbert Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre Trained Language Models, (2019); Baginski, Stephen P., Why Do Managers Explain Their Earnings Forecasts?, Journal of Accounting Research, 42, 1, pp. 1-29, (2004); Vocal Delivery Quality in Earnings Conference Calls, (2023); Baker, Scott R., Measuring economic policy uncertainty, Quarterly Journal of Economics, 131, 4, pp. 1593-1636, (2016); Ball, Ray, On earnings and cash flows as predictors of future cash flows, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 73, 1, (2022); Beaver, William H., Increased market response to earnings announcements in the 21st century: An Empirical Investigation, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 69, 1, (2020); Beaver, William H., Conditional and unconditional conservatism: Concepts and modeling, Review of Accounting Studies, 10, 2-3, pp. 269-309, (2005); Nips, (2000)","","John Wiley and Sons Inc","","","","","","1475679X; 00218456","","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212279584"

Existing forecasting methods, relying primarily on time-series data, technical indicators, and sentiment analysis, often fail to capture the semantic depth of background knowledge, particularly the influence of real-time events. To address this limitation, we propose MoF, a background-aware multi-source fusion mechanism for financial trend forecasting. MoF integrates stock price data with background knowledge on the impact of real-time events on stock trends, which includes key information from policy documents and stock commentaries, and subsequently leverages the MacBERT model to generate feature vectors for stock prediction. Our results show that MoF, by incorporating the influence of real-time events, improves accuracy and interpretability in stock trend forecasting, surpassing LSTM-based models with over 90% accuracy in predicting market fluctuations and providing reliable directional predictions. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Background-aware; Financial trend; LLM; Macbert","","","","This study was supported by Guangdong Province Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project (GDSKGJ247), and Guangzhou Science and Technology Plan Project (202201011701).","Bollerslev, Tim, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Journal of Econometrics, 31, 3, pp. 307-327, (1986); Journal of the Operational Research Society, (2025); Chen, Tianqi, XGBoost: A scalable tree boosting system, 13-17-August-2016, pp. 785-794, (2016); Corr, (2014); Revisiting Pre Trained Models for Chinese Natural Language Processing, (2020); Junqué de Fortuny, Enric, Evaluating and understanding text-based stock price prediction models, Information Processing and Management, 50, 2, pp. 426-441, (2014); Corr, (2018); Pesit South Campus, (2016); International Journal of Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, (2017); D Long Term Time Series Forecasting with Vision Transformer","","Springer","","","","","","15729974; 09277099","069112549X; 9780691125497","","","English","Article","aip","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85212083474"

To represent this complexity, researchers have utilized multi-source data, such as financial news and macro market indicators, for better performance. However, these efforts often ignore the internal knowledge among these data or suffer from the high cost of acquiring diverse knowledge. Thus, we propose a LLM-driven knowledge enhancement method for securities index prediction. Specifically, we collect the daily data of Shanghai Stock Exchange indexes and their related market indicators and model the internal knowledge among them as triplets. Then we leverage LLM as a knowledge base to acquire diverse knowledge efficiently. Finally, we integrate the knowledge and numeric multi-source data as a heterogeneous graph and apply a GNN model to predict the trend of securities indexes.

At any given date, it averages future quantities over generated price paths whose past history matches, or ‘shadows’, the actual (observed) history. We test our approach using paths generated from a maximum entropy model of financial prices, based on a recently proposed multi-scale analogue of the standard skewness and kurtosis called ‘Scattering Spectra’. This model promotes the diversity of generated paths while reproducing main statistical properties of financial prices, including stylized facts such as volatility roughness. Our method yields state-of-the-art predictions for future realized volatility and allows one to determine conditional option smiles for the S&P500 that outperform both the most recent low-parametric models and the option market itself.

The exchange introduced a block trading facility in 2018, but in December 2019, it changed the minimum size threshold that allows market participants to trade a block and report it with a delay. Consistent with theoretical predictions and earlier empirical findings, we largely confirm that the information content of large trades is significantly lower in the upstairs market than in the downstairs. In contrast with prior research in traditional markets, we find that delaying the reporting of a block traded away from the continuous book discourages informed trading and potentially decreases the informativeness of trading and, therefore, information efficiency.

Traditional methods, particularly classical machine learning models, struggle with these predictions because they cannot effectively process and interpret extensive textual data contained in earnings reports and often overlook nuances that influence market movements. This paper introduces an advanced approach by employing Large Language Models (LLMs) instruction fine-tuned with a novel combination of instruction-based techniques and quantized low-rank adaptation (QLoRA) compression. Our methodology integrates 'base factors', such as financial metric growth and earnings transcripts, with 'external factors', including recent market indices performances and analyst grades, to create a rich, supervised dataset. This comprehensive dataset enables our models to achieve superior predictive performance in terms of accuracy, weighted Fl, and Matthews correlation coefficient (M CC), especially evident in the comparison with benchmarks such as GPT-4. We specifically highlight the efficacy of the llama-3-8b-Instruct-4bit model, which showcases significant improvements over baseline models. The paper also discusses the potential of expanding the output capabilities to include a 'Hold''''' option and extending the prediction horizon, aiming to accommodate various investment styles and time frames.

LLMs have found significant applications across various sectors, notably in finance for stock market predictions, and in healthcare, where complex medical data is analyzed for diagnosis at an early stage, improving diagnostic procedures, and personalized treatment planning. In healthcare, where complex medical data is analyzed for diagnosis at an early stage. Despite the immense potential, challenges such as overwhelming Big Data, model hallucinations, and ethical concerns about patient privacy and bias persist. Method: We implemented novel strategies like CanPrompt to mitigate the accuracy and hallucination concerns to ensure responsible deployment. The CanPrompt strategy utilizes prompt engineering combined with few-shot and in-context learning to significantly enhance model accuracy by generating more relevant answers. The models were tested against a specialized dataset from MedQuAD, focusing on cancer, and evaluated using metrics like ROUGE and BERTScore to assess the semantic and syntactic accuracy of generated responses against validated ""Gold Answers"". Through this approach, the study seeks to outline the potential and limitations of LLMs in improving cancer care. Result: After applying CanPrompt with models Mistral 7x8b, Falcon 40b, and Llama 3-8b, BERTScore results showed Mistral leading with an accuracy around 84%, Falcon slightly lower, and Llama the least, with respective precision scores also reflecting a similar trend. Conclusion: The study demonstrates the promise of LLMs in cancer care through the introduction of CanPrompt. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","and Llama 3-8b; BERTScore; Cancer; Falcon 40b; Large Language Model (LLM); Mistral 7x8B; prompt; ROGUE score","Commerce; Decentralized finance; Diagnosis; Diseases; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Oncology; Personalized medicine; Syntactics; And llama 3-8b; BERTScore; Cancer; Falcon 40b; Language model; Large language model; Medical data; Mistral 7x8b; Prompt; ROGUE score; Semantics","","","This work was supported by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC) Discovery Grant (RGPIN-2023-05341).","Kelly, Christopher J., Key challenges for delivering clinical impact with artificial intelligence, BMC Medicine, 17, 1, (2019); International Journal of Multidisciplinary Sciences and Arts, (2023); Aldoseri, Abdulaziz, Re-Thinking Data Strategy and Integration for Artificial Intelligence: Concepts, Opportunities, and Challenges, Applied Sciences (Switzerland), 13, 12, (2023); Ji, Ziwei, Survey of Hallucination in Natural Language Generation, ACM Computing Surveys, 55, 12, (2023); Tian, Shubo, Opportunities and challenges for ChatGPT and large language models in biomedicine and health, Briefings in Bioinformatics, 25, 1, (2024); Future Healthc J, (2019); Alowais, Shuroug A., Revolutionizing healthcare: the role of artificial intelligence in clinical practice, BMC Medical Education, 23, 1, (2023); Perez-Lopez, Raquel, A framework for artificial intelligence in cancer research and precision oncology, npj Precision Oncology, 7, 1, (2023); McKinney, Scott Mayer, International evaluation of an AI system for breast cancer screening, Nature, 577, 7788, pp. 89-94, (2020); Biorxiv, (2025)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","21st IEEE Conference on Computational Intelligence in Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, CIBCB 2024","","Natal","203230","","9798350356632","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85207474816"

However, the finance sector presents a distinct challenge due to its dependence on time-series data for complex forecasting tasks. In this study, we introduce a novel framework called LLMFactor, which employs Sequential Knowledge-Guided Prompting (SKGP) to identify factors that influence stock movements using LLMs. Unlike previous methods that relied on keyphrases or sentiment analysis, this approach focuses on extracting factors more directly related to stock market dynamics, providing clear explanations for complex temporal changes. Our framework directs the LLMs to create background knowledge through a fill-in-the-blank strategy and then discerns potential factors affecting stock prices from related news. Guided by background knowledge and identified factors, we leverage historical stock prices in textual format to predict stock movement. An extensive evaluation of the LLMFactor framework across four benchmark datasets from both the U.S. and Chinese stock markets demonstrates its superiority over existing state-of-the-art methods and its effectiveness in financial time-series forecasting. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Commerce; Costs; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Background knowledge; Key-phrase; Language model; Movement prediction; Performance; Sentiment analysis; Stock movement; Stock price; Text analysis; Time-series data; Time series","","","We sincerely thank the anonymous reviewers for their reviews.

As data-driven methods, existing factor mining models can be categorized into symbol-based and neural-based models. Symbol-based models are interpretable but inefficient, while neural-based approaches are efficient but lack interpretability. Hence, mining interpretable factors effectively presents a significant challenge. Inspired by the success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in various tasks, we propose a FActor Mining Agent (FAMA) model that enables LLMs to integrate the strengths of both neural and symbolic models for factor mining. In this paper, FAMA consists of two main components: Cross-Sample Selection (CSS) and Chain-of-Experience (CoE). CSS addresses the homogeneity challenges in LLMs during factor mining by assimilating diverse factors as in-context samples, whereas CoE enables LLMs to leverage past successful mining experiences, expediting the mining of effective factors. Experimental evaluations on real-world stock market data demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by surpassing the SOTA RankIC by 0.006 and RankICIR by 0.105 in predicting S&P 500 returns.

Utilizing a dataset of 965,375 U.S. financial news articles from 2010 to 2023, our research demonstrates that the GPT-3-based OPT model significantly outperforms other models, achieving a prediction accuracy of 74.4% for stock market returns. Our findings reveal that the advanced capabilities of LLMs, particularly OPT, surpass traditional sentiment analysis methods, such as the Loughran-McDonald dictionary model, in predicting and explaining stock returns. For instance, a self-financing strategy based on OPT scores achieves a Sharpe ratio of 3.05 over our sample period, compared to a Sharpe ratio of 1.23 for the strategy based on the dictionary model.

It is important that CCPs have robust risk management tools in order to protect themselves from failing due to a defaulting member. In this paper a new model using a Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Network (BiGAN), a type of generative AI model, is proposed to estimate Value at Risk (VaR), a common metric used to compute initial margin for CCPs. Fifteen years of closing prices from the S&P 500 index was used as the dataset. The model was backtested for a period of four years. The results were evaluated using the number of breaches, Kupiec test, excess margin as well as two procyclicality measures: the standard deviation and peak to trough ratio of margin. The results were compared against three widely used models: filtered historical simulation method, historical VaR and parametric VaR. The results from this study showed that VaR computed using the BiGAN model produced 19 breaches on average for the four-year test period. While the experimental results show the proposed model is comparable with other models in terms of accuracy, its standard deviation for margin calls is lower which results in more short-term stability and a lower excess margin compared to the traditional models. The results of this research encourage further research on using BiGAN to estimate VAR. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bidirectional Generative Adversarial Networks; Central Counterparty; Financial Risk Management; Generative AI; Value-at-Risk","Adversarial machine learning; Decentralized finance; Adversarial networks; Bidirectional generative adversarial network; Central counterparty; Financial risk management; Generative AI; Management tool; Risks management; Standard deviation; Systemic risks; Value at Risk; Generative adversarial networks","","","","undefined; Handbook of Financial Risk Management, (2020); Resilience of Central Counterparties Ccps Further Guidance on the Pfmi, (2017); Ccp Initial Margin Models in Europe, (2023); Donahue, Jeff, Adversarial feature learning, (2017); Dumoulin, Vincent, Adversarially learned inference, (2017); Risk Management with Generative Adversarial Networks, (2019); Value at Risk Estimation with Generative Adversarial Networks, (2021); Using Generative Adversarial Networks as A Value at Risk Estimator, (2020); Arian, Hamid, Encoded Value-at-Risk: A machine learning approach for portfolio risk measurement, Mathematics and Computers in Simulation, 202, pp. 500-525, (2022)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","Center of Excellence (CoE), Human Centric Engineering (HUMIC); IEEE Indonesian Section","7th International Conference on Data Science and Its Applications, ICoDSA 2024","","Bali; Aston Kuta Hotel","202354","","9798350365351","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85204283630"

However, current research appears to be lacking in-depth exploration of this particular aspect within the Bitcoin market. This study aims to explore the impact of market participants' sentiment on risk prediction in the bitcoin market. We first applied ChatGPT to analyze the sentiment of crawled Bitcoin-related news headlines. Meanwhile, Monte Carlo simulation was employed to calculate value at risk (VaR). And we selected five conventional factors, including Bitcoin price, transaction volume, market share, hash rate, and average difficulty of mining. Finally, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) regression model was used to construct the model for predicting the risk of bitcoin market. We made a comparison between the accuracy outcomes when considering and not considering sentiment as factors.

Their unprecedented scale and associated high hardware cost have impeded their broader adoption, calling for efficient hardware designs. With the large hardware needed to simply run LLM inference, evaluating different hardware designs becomes a new bottleneck. This work introduces LLMCompass1, a hardware evaluation framework for LLM inference workloads. LLMCompass is fast, accurate, versatile, and able to describe and evaluate different hardware designs. LLMCompass includes a mapper to automatically find performance-optimal mapping and scheduling. It also incorporates an area-based cost model to help architects reason about their design choices. Compared to real-world hardware, LLMCompass' estimated latency achieves an average 10.9% error rate across various operators with various input sizes and an average 4.1% error rate for LLM inference. With LLMCompass, simulating a 4-NVIDIA A100 GPU node running GPT-3 175B inference can be done within 16 minutes on commodity hardware, including 26,400 rounds of the mapper's parameter search. With the aid of LLMCompass, this work draws architectural implications and explores new cost-effective hardware designs. By reducing the compute capability or replacing High Bandwidth Memory (HBM) with traditional DRAM, these new designs can achieve as much as 3.41x improvement in performance/cost compared to an NVIDIA A100, making them promising choices for democratizing LLMs.1Available at https://github.com/PrincetonUniversity/LLMCompass. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","accelerator; area model; cost model; Large language model; performance model","Computational linguistics; Cost effectiveness; Area model; Cost models; Error rate; Hardware cost; Hardware design; Hardware evaluations; Language model; Large language model; Model inference; Performance Modeling; Dynamic random access storage","","","We would like to thank Qixuan (Maki) Yu, Zhongming Yu, Haiyue Ma, Yanghui Ou, Christopher Batten, and the entire Princeton Parallel Group, for their feedback, suggestions, and encouragement.

The study employs three distinct text summarization methods to efficiently process a substantial volume of financial news. This approach enhances the depth and accuracy of subsequent sentiment analysis. Sentiment is assessed through a combination of lexicon-based and deep learning methods. These insights, along with technical market data, are integrated into a Light Gradient Boosting Machine (LGBM) model, which is refined through Bayesian hyperparameter optimization and assessed via cross-validation. The results demonstrate that the model’s performance peaks at a standard deviation coefficient of 0.25, indicating an optimal balance for the three-class classification problem. Furthermore, the feature importance analysis reveals that while temporal and market-related factors play a significant role, sentiment features captured by FinBERT and VADER substantially contribute to the model’s predictive power. A notable finding of this research is the superior performance of FinBERT over GPT-3.5 in feature importance analysis, underscoring the efficacy of specialized language models in financial contexts. By marrying natural language processing techniques with machine learning, the study presents a novel approach to understanding the predictive power of news sentiment in financial markets. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Feature importance; Financial forecasting; LGBM; Sentiment analysis; Text summarization","Classification (of information); Commerce; Deep learning; Financial markets; Investments; Learning systems; Feature importance; Financial forecasting; Gradient boosting; Importance analysis; Light gradient boosting machine; Light gradients; Performance; Predictive power; Sentiment analysis; Text Summarisation","","","","Scientific Bulletin Economic Sciences, (2012); Conrad, Jennifer S., When is bad news really bad news?, Journal of Finance, 57, 6, pp. 2507-2532, (2002); Partners Universal International Innovation Journal, (2023); Li, Xiaoyang, Can ChatGPT reduce human financial analysts’ optimistic biases?, Economic and Political Studies, 12, 1, pp. 20-33, (2024); Vargas, Manuel R., Deep learning for stock market prediction from financial news articles, pp. 60-65, (2017); Mohan, Saloni, Stock price prediction using news sentiment analysis, pp. 205-208, (2019); Wang, Qili, Combining the wisdom of crowds and technical analysis for financial market prediction using deep random subspace ensembles, Neurocomputing, 299, pp. 51-61, (2018); Tetlock, Paul C., Giving content to investor sentiment: The role of media in the stock market, Journal of Finance, 62, 3, pp. 1139-1168, (2007); Loughran, Tim, When Is a Liability Not a Liability?

Currently, machine learning and deep learning algorithms (ML&DL) have been widely applied for stock trend predictions, leading to significant progress. However, these methods fail to provide reasons for predictions, lacking interpretability and reasoning processes. Also, they can not integrate textual information such as financial news or reports. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have remarkable textual understanding and generation ability. But due to the scarcity of financial training datasets and limited integration with real-time knowledge, LLMs still suffer from hallucinations and are unable to keep up with the latest information. To tackle these challenges, we first release AlphaFin datasets, combining traditional research datasets, real-time financial data, and handwritten chain-of-thought (CoT) data. It has a positive impact on training LLMs for completing financial analysis. We then use AlphaFin datasets to benchmark a state-of-the-art method, called Stock-Chain, for effectively tackling the financial analysis task, which integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques. Extensive experiments are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our framework on financial analysis. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Chain-of-Thoughts; Finance; Financial Question Answering; Large Language Models; Retrieval-Augmented Generation; Stock Trend Prediction","Computational linguistics; Deep learning; Forecasting; Learning algorithms; Chain-of-thought; Financial analysis; Financial question answering; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Question Answering; Real- time; Retrieval-augmented generation; Stock trend prediction; Finance","","","","undefined, (2021); Finbert Financial Sentiment Analysis with Pre Trained Language Models, (2019); Plato Xl Exploring the Large Scale Pre Training of Dialogue Generation, (2021); Neural Machine Translation with Monolingual Translation Memory, (2021); Finqa A Dataset of Numerical Reasoning Over Financial Data, (2021); Chen, Zhiyu, CONVFINQA: Exploring the Chain of Numerical Reasoning in Conversational Finance Question Answering, pp. 6279-6292, (2022); Proceedings of the Workshop on Text Summarization Branches Out Was 2004, (2004); Datayes Financial Data and Analytics Platform, (2021); Bert Pre Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Dredze, Mark H., How Twitter is changing the nature of financial news discovery, Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, 01-July-2016, (2016)","Calzolari, N.; Kan, M.-Y.; Hoste, V.; Lenci, A.; Sakti, S.; Xue, N.","European Language Resources Association (ELRA)","Aequa-Tech; Baidu; Bloomberg; Dataforce (Transperfect); et al.; Intesa San Paolo Bank","Joint 30th International Conference on Computational Linguistics and 14th International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation, LREC-COLING 2024","","Hybrid, Torino","199620","","9782493814104","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85195934691"

Quantitative trading automatically executes transactions through written programs, eliminating the interference of human subjective factors on transaction execution. But the threshold for quantitative trading is high, requiring researchers to have a deep understanding of mathematics, statistics, finance, and computer technology. The newly emerged Large Language Model (LLM) can help users get started to a certain extent, by giving the general framework of the code, so that users can have a preliminary understanding of the countermeasures faster and more accurately. In terms of model training and testing, this paper adopts the CSI 300 index obtained from tushare platform to study the results of daily data, weekly data and monthly data after training. This project trained a stock price prediction model using long short-term memory (LSTM) methods. Then, the backtest model was established with the classic double moving average strategy in quantitative trading, and the backtrader platform was used to visualize the return results simulated by the backtest. Finally, we discussed the risks of using LLM codes to execute quantitative trading. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; LLM; Quantitative trading","","","","","Chang, Catie E., Time-frequency dynamics of resting-state brain connectivity measured with fMRI, NeuroImage, 50, 1, pp. 81-98, (2010); Hutchison, R.

As sentiments expressed on social media platforms wield substantial influence over cryptocurrency market dynamics, sentiment analysis has emerged as a crucial tool for gauging public opinion and predicting market trends. This paper explores fine-tuning techniques for large language models to enhance sentiment analysis performance. Experimental results demonstrate a significant average zero-shot performance gain of 40% on unseen tasks after fine-tuning, highlighting its potential. Additionally, the impact of instruction-based fine-tuning on models of varying scales is examined, revealing that larger models benefit from instruction tuning, achieving the highest average accuracy score of 75.16%. In contrast, smaller-scale models may experience reduced generalization due to complete model capacity utilization. To gain deeper insight into instruction effectiveness, the paper presents experimental investigations under different instruction tuning setups. Results show the model achieves an average accuracy score of 72.38% for short and simple instructions, outperforming long and complex instructions by over 12%. Finally, the paper explores the relationship between fine-tuning corpus size and model performance, identifying an optimal corpus size of 6,000 data points for the highest performance across different models.

Despite the progress, facial avatars reconstructed from commodity hardware are incomplete and miss out on parts of the side and back of the head, severely limiting the usability of the avatar. This limitation in prior work stems from their requirement of face tracking, which fails for profile and back views. To address this issue, we propose to learn person-specific animatable avatars from images without assuming to have access to precise facial expression tracking. At the core of our method, we leverage a 3D-aware generative model that is trained to reproduce the distribution of facial expressions from the training data. To train this appearance model, we only assume to have a collection of 2D images with the corresponding camera parameters. For controlling the model, we learn a mapping from 3DMM facial expression parameters to the latent space of the generative model. This mapping can be learned by sampling the latent space of the appearance model and reconstructing the facial parameters from a normalized frontal view, where facial expression estimation performs well. With this scheme, we decouple 3D appearance reconstruction and animation control to achieve high fidelity in image synthesis. In a series of experiments, we compare our proposed technique to state-of-the-art monocular methods and show superior quality while not requiring expression tracking of the training data. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","3D facial avatar; facial reenactment; personalized GAN","Computer vision; Face recognition; Image reconstruction; Three dimensional computer graphics; Visual communication; 3d facial avatar; Appearance models; Digital humans; Facial Expressions; Facial reenactment; Generative model; Human head; Learn+; Personalized GAN; Training data; Mapping","","","We thank Balamurugan Thambiraja for his help with the video recording, Riccardo Marin and Ilya Petrov for proofreading, and all participants of the study.

However, traditional models often fall short due to low-quality data, market volatility, and the complexity of global economic trends. Generative AI offers a transformative approach by improving data management processes, enhancing prediction accuracy, and overcoming the limitations of current forecasting models. This research explores the potential of Generative AI to enrich financial data through techniques like data augmentation, synthetic data generation, and anomaly detection. Specifically, the study investigates how integrating Generative AI into data preprocessing can enhance predictive modeling using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for time series forecasting, particularly in stock prices. The research also explores feature engineering techniques such as moving averages, Relative Strength Index (RSI), and volatility metrics, which are crucial for capturing market trends. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are employed to create additional realistic trading scenarios, boosting model robustness. Implemented using Python, the findings reveal that the combined LSTM and GAN model improved prediction accuracy over traditional methods, achieving an RMSE of 0.096 and R-squared (R ) 0.85 in stock price forecasts. The incorporation of synthetic data with traditional financial metrics leads to an improvement in the model's ability to predict short-term market trends. These findings suggest that the use of Generative AI can provide a more resilient and adaptive approach to financial market prediction, opening new avenues for research in the domain. Future research could focus on expanding the scope to include multi-market scenarios and incorporating real-time data streams. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data augmentation; financial market prediction; GAN; generative AI; LSTM; synthetic data","Anomaly detection; Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Costs; Data accuracy; Electronic trading; Forecasting; Information management; Investments; Market Research; Prediction models; Adversarial networks; Data augmentation; Decisions makings; Financial market prediction; Generative AI; Market prediction; Market trends; Prediction accuracy; Short term memory; Synthetic data; Financial markets","","","","Hung, Minchih, AI-Driven Intraday Trading: Applying Machine Learning and Market Activity for Enhanced Decision Support in Financial Markets, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 12953-12962, (2024); Chhajer, Parshv, The applications of artificial neural networks, support vector machines, and long–short term memory for stock market prediction, Decision Analytics Journal, 2, (2022); Castello, Oleksandr, Optimal Time Varying Parameters in Yield Curve Modeling and Forecasting: A Simulation Study on BRICS Countries, Computational Economics, 65, 4, pp. 2081-2113, (2025); Al Naqbi, Humaid, Enhancing Work Productivity through Generative Artificial Intelligence: A Comprehensive Literature Review, Sustainability (Switzerland), 16, 3, (2024); Yenduri, Gokul, GPT (Generative Pre-Trained Transformer) - A Comprehensive Review on Enabling Technologies, Potential Applications, Emerging Challenges, and Future Directions, IEEE Access, 12, pp. 54608-54649, (2024); Perera, U.

This technology has had a significant impact on the economic, political, and socio-cultural life in many countries. In this review article by using the descriptive-analytical method, the authors strive to define artificial intelligence within modern scientific discourse and introduce two practical applications of AI technologies. They discuss the ""practical mode"", which is used for effective management and accident prevention in industrial machinery, medicine, transportation, construction, oil and gas industries, mining, the nuclear sector, and more. Additionally, they introduce ""generative AI"", which is used for translating large texts, predicting business processes, evaluating financial and commodity markets, assessing societal feedback to any economic, political, and social changes, mastering risk management, and more. The article also explores the main challenges and risks of AI for modern society, including the creation of fake narratives, information bubbles, saturation, and other manipulation tools employed by technocratic elites in their quest for dominance. The concentration and distribution of AI development centers in specific areas could lead to increased inequality and tension between the North and South regions. Controlling the AI domain to protect national interests and maintain modern international relations poses a fundamental challenge for political and economic groups, institutions, and society. Researchers attempt to make predictions about the impact on energy, which will intensify with increased energy consumption and competition over rare elements. This rapidly growing demand cannot be met by ""clean energy"", so the energy transition might be slowed down by AI.

In this paper, we compare three sequential deep learning models - LSTM, Transformer, and Large Language Models (LLMs) - for stock price prediction. By transforming the regression problem of predicting daily log returns into a classification task, we evaluate the models' classification accuracies, with the Transformer achieving the highest accuracy of 22%, followed by LSTM (15.6%) and LLM (15.3%). Regression metrics showed LSTM initially performing better, with a lower RMSE (180.92) than LLM (1739.61). However, outlier predictions in the LLM, caused by incomplete number outputs, inflated its error. After removing these outliers, LLM's RMSE improved significantly to 33.85, surpassing LSTM. These results demonstrate the potential of Transformer and LLM models for financial time series prediction. Future work will explore incorporating self-reflection mechanisms in LLM predictions and extending the comparison to multivariate financial time series incorporating textual data and other features. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep Learning; Finance; Large Language Model; Survey; Time Series Forecasting","Decentralized finance; Deep learning; Prediction models; Time series; Comparatives studies; Financial time series forecasting; Inherent complexity; Language model; Large language model; Learning models; Stock price; Time series forecasting; Time-series analysis; Contrastive Learning","","","","Adebiyi, Ayodele Ariyo, Stock price prediction using the ARIMA model, pp. 106-112, (2014); Nh Ttc A Gradient Based Framework for Generalized Anticipatory Collision Avoidance, (2019); Lin, Yuling, An SVM-based approach for stock market trend prediction, Proceedings of the International Joint Conference on Neural Networks, (2013); Predicting the Direction of Stock Market Prices Using Random Forest, (2016); Selvin, Sreelekshmy, Stock price prediction using LSTM, RNN and CNN-sliding window model, 2017-January, pp. 1643-1647, (2017); Shuzhen, Wang, A Stock Price Prediction Method Based on BiLSTM and Improved Transformer, IEEE Access, 11, pp. 104211-104223, (2023); Transformer for Times Series an Application to the S P500, (2024); Swathi, T., An optimal deep learning-based LSTM for stock price prediction using twitter sentiment analysis, Applied Intelligence, 52, 12, pp. 13675-13688, (2022); A Comprehensive Capability Analysis of Gpt 3 and Gpt 3 5 Series Models, (2023); Koa, Kelvin J.L., Learning to Generate Explainable Stock Predictions using Self-Reflective Large Language Models, pp. 4304-4315, (2024)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","11th International Conference on Soft Computing and Machine Intelligence, ISCMI 2024","","Melbourne; VIC","206431","26400154; 26400146","","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-105001566756"

These models often overlook the nuanced impacts of real-time sentiment, economic indicators, and related metals like silver. This study proposes a novel framework to combine gold prices with other relevant features to improve predictive performance in the precious metal market. Further, we employ three advanced recent deep learning models, LSTM, N-HiTS, and TSMixer, and evaluate their performance with various metrics using the different combinations of the proposed features. The results demonstrate that incorporating the proposed additional features, such as silver prices and sentiment analysis, significantly improves forecasting accuracy, amidst the volatile and uncertain market conditions spanning from 2020 to 2024. The best-performing models outperform traditional models, such as ARIMA.

This work focuses on the new approach to the stock options valuation by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) through the integration of quantitative (i.e. financial features-lagged prices, moving averages, and volatility indicators) and qualitative data (i.e. news data, including article titles, full textual content, and publication dates). More specifically, our approach fuses sentiment analysis from LLMs applied to financial news from two reputable outlets (i.e. Economic Times and Yahoo Finance India) with quantitative data on stock options, which includes stock option closing price. By conducting experiments on companies from the NIFTY 50 index using ChatGPT-3.5, ChatGPT-4, and LLaMA 3.1, we show that our method achieves superior prediction accuracy compared to other similar approaches.

To make this analysis more effective, we employed ChatGPT. First, from the summary of daily financial updates, we identify top global news headlines that could have a significant influence on stock markets. Second, for each headline, we questioned ChatGPT to answer whether the news might lead to a rise, a fall in stock prices or an indecisive future. This two-stage method proves more effective than a direct question on the entire text. By gathering ChatGPT's predictions day by day, we formed an overall market sentiment score and transform this score into a practical investment strategy in the NASDAQ index, demonstrating the significance of minimizing noise in sentiment scores by initially accumulating and then detrending them. This approach showcases that ChatGPT's analysis of news headlines can provide valuable insights into future stock market behaviours and be a valuable tool to develop intuitive NLP-driven investment strategies leveraging news predictive power. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Bloomberg News; ChatGPT; NLP; SentimentScore","Commerce; Financial markets; Bloomberg; Bloomberg news; ChatGPT; Detrending; Investment strategy; Large datasets; Sentiment scores; Sentimentscore; Stock price; Two-stage methods; Marketplaces","","","","Tetlock, Paul C., Giving content to investor sentiment: The role of media in the stock market, Journal of Finance, 62, 3, pp. 1139-1168, (2007); Schumaker, Robert P., Textual analysis of stock market prediction using breaking financial news: The AZFin text system, ACM Transactions on Information Systems, 27, 2, (2009); Georgetown Journal of International Law, (2015); Fatouros, Georgios, DeepVaR: a framework for portfolio risk assessment leveraging probabilistic deep neural networks, Digital Finance, 5, 1, pp. 29-56, (2023); Poria, Soujanya, Aspect extraction for opinion mining with a deep convolutional neural network, Knowledge-Based Systems, 108, pp. 42-49, (2016); Bert Pre Training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding, (2018); Liu, Zhuang, FinBERT: A pre-trained financial language representation model for financial text mining, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021-January, pp. 4513-4519, (2020); Loughran, Tim, When Is a Liability Not a Liability?

However, finetuning LLMs using backpropagation requires excessive memory (especially from intermediate activations) for resource-constrained devices. While Forward-mode Auto-Differentiation (AD) can significantly reduce memory footprint from activations, we observe that directly applying it to LLM finetuning results in slow convergence and poor accuracy. In this paper, we introduce SPRY, an FL algorithm that splits trainable weights of an LLM among participating clients, such that each client computes gradients using Forward-mode AD that are closer estimations of the true gradients. SPRY achieves a low memory footprint, high accuracy, and fast convergence. We formally prove that the global gradients in SPRY are unbiased estimators of true global gradients for homogeneous data distributions across clients, while heterogeneity increases bias of the estimates. We also derive SPRY's convergence rate, showing that the gradients decrease inversely proportional to the number of FL rounds, indicating the convergence up to the limits of heterogeneity. Empirically, SPRY reduces the memory footprint during training by 1.4-7.1× in contrast to backpropagation, while reaching comparable accuracy, across a wide range of language tasks, models, and FL settings. SPRY reduces the convergence time by 1.2-20.3× and achieves 5.2-13.5% higher accuracy against state-of-the-art zero-order methods. When finetuning Llama2-7B with LoRA, compared to the peak memory consumption of 33.9GB of backpropagation, SPRY only consumes 6.2GB of peak memory. For OPT13B, the reduction is from 76.5GB to 10.8GB. SPRY makes feasible previously impossible FL deployments on commodity mobile and edge devices.

Financial time-series prediction is no exception. Hence, the volatility trend prediction in financial time series (FTS) has been an active topic for several decades. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GAN), which have been studied extensively in image processing and have achieved excellent results, we present the ordinal regression GAN for financial volatility trends (ORGAN-FVT) method for the end-to-end multi-classification task of FTS. An improved generative model based on convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) and multilayer perceptron (MLP) is proposed to capture temporal features effectively and mine the data distribution of volatility trends (short, neutral, and long) from given FTS data. Meanwhile, ordinal regression is leveraged for the discriminator to improve the multi-classification performance, making the model more practical. Finally, we empirically compare ORGAN-FVT with several state-of-the-art approaches on three real-world stock datasets: MICROSOFT(MSFT), Tesla(TSLA), and The People’s Insurance Company of China(PAICC). ORGAN-FVT demonstrated significantly better AUC and F1 scores, at most 20.81% higher than its competitors. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Classification; Convolutional LSTM; Financial time series; Generative adversarial nets","Convolution; Forecasting; Image processing; Insurance; Long short-term memory; Time series; Classification approach; Convolutional LSTM; Feature representation; Financial time series; High-dimensional; Higher-dimensional; Multi-classification; Network-based; Ordinal regression; Trend prediction; Generative adversarial networks","","","This research was funded by China Scholarship Council, National Natural Science Foundation of China, grant number 71971174, Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province, grant number 2020YFG0326 and Department of Science and Technology of Sichuan Province, grant number 2021JDR0222.","Maleki, Mohsen, Time series modelling to forecast the confirmed and recovered cases of COVID-19, Travel Medicine and Infectious Disease, 37, (2020); Berat Sezer, Omer, Financial time series forecasting with deep learning: A systematic literature review: 2005–2019, Applied Soft Computing, 90, (2020); Gao, Zhongke, Complex network analysis of time series, Europhysics Letters, 116, 5, (2016); Liu, Lei, An Improved Quantile-Point-Based Evolutionary Segmentation Representation Method of Financial Time Series, International Arab Journal of Information Technology, 19, 6, pp. 873-883, (2022); Yang, Qiang S., 10 Challenging problems in data mining research, International Journal of Information Technology and Decision Making, 5, 4, pp. 597-604, (2006); Bagnall, Anthony J., The great time series classification bake off: a review and experimental evaluation of recent algorithmic advances, Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery, 31, 3, pp. 606-660, (2017); Xi, Xiaopeng, Fast time series classification using numerosity reduction, 2006, pp. 1033-1040, (2006); Karim, Fazle Shahnawaz Muhibul, Multivariate LSTM-FCNs for time series classification, Neural Networks, 116, pp. 237-245, (2019); Jiang, Wenqian, A GAN-Based Anomaly Detection Approach for Imbalanced Industrial Time Series, IEEE Access, 7, pp. 143608-143619, (2019); Ib Gan A Unified Approach for Multivariate Time Series Classification Under Class Imbalance Arxiv Preprint Arxiv, (2021)","","Springer Science and Business Media B.V.","","","","","","18756883; 18756891","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85150999772"

The core methodology these models use is to learn the distribution of the underlying data, similar to the classical methods common in finance of fitting statistical models to data. In this work, we explore the efficacy of using modern machine learning methods, specifically conditional importance weighted autoencoders (a variant of variational autoencoders) and conditional normalizing flows, for the task of modeling the returns of equities. The main problem we work to address is modeling the joint distribution of all the members of the S&P 500, or, in other words, learning a 500-dimensional joint distribution. We show that this generative model has a broad range of applications in finance, including generating realistic synthetic data, volatility and correlation estimation, risk analysis (e.g., value at risk, or VaR, of portfolios), and portfolio optimization. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Generative Modeling; Normalizing Flows; Portfolio Optimization; Risk Forecasting; Stock Returns; Variational Autoencoders","Financial data processing; Financial markets; Investments; Risk analysis; Risk assessment; Risk perception; Value engineering; Auto encoders; Generative model; Joint distributions; Machine-learning; Normalizing flow; Portfolio optimization; Risk forecasting; Stock returns; Synthetic data; Variational autoencoder; Machine learning","","","","Invertible Residual Networks, (2018); A Data Driven Market Simulator for Small Data Environments, (2020); Burda, Yuri, Importance weighted autoencoders, (2016); Nice Non Linear Independent Components Estimation, (2014); Dinh, Laurent, Density estimation using real NVP, (2017); Engle, Robert F., Dynamic conditional correlation: A simple class of multivariate generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity models, Journal of Business and Economic Statistics, 20, 3, pp. 339-350, (2002); Econometrica, (1987); Fama, Eugene F., A five-factor asset pricing model, Journal of Financial Economics, 116, 1, pp. 1-22, (2015); Journal of Business, (1980); Glosten, Lawrence R., On the Relation between the Expected Value and the Volatility of the Nominal Excess Return on Stocks, Journal of Finance, 48, 5, pp. 1779-1801, (1993)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","J.P.

Numerous studies have used a supervised learning approach to predict PEAD, using earnings, fundamental and technical factors. However, there is a lack of study on how the context of the earnings call can be used for the PEAD prediction task. This paper uses computational linguistics techniques and large language models to examine the effectiveness of incorporating textual and contextual features from earnings calls for the PEAD prediction task. Our proposed supervised model includes four categories of features: 1) textual features, 2) contextual features, 3) earnings features, and 4) fundamental and technical features. We study the proposed model using earnings from 2010/01/01 to 2022/12/31 of all point-in-time S&P500 constituents in the US stock market. Our results show that contextual features provide information unexplained by earnings, fundamental and technical features, improving the average returns per trade of a hypothetical long-short portfolio against baseline solution in out-of-sample across all four different abnormal return calculations, ranging from 53 to 354 basis points and 16.9% to 108.5% improvement from baseline model, which uses only earnings, fundamental and technical features. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","computational linguistics; earnings call; large language models; machine learning; Post-earnings announcement drift","Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Forecasting; Investments; Machine learning; Contextual feature; Drift predictions; Earning call; Fundamental features; Language model; Large language model; Machine-learning; Post-earning announcement drift; Prediction tasks; Technical features; Computational linguistics","","","","Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate, (2014); Balakrishnan, Karthik, Post loss/profit announcement drift, Journal of Accounting and Economics, 50, 1, pp. 20-41, (2010); Journal of Accounting Research, (1968); Battalio, Robert H., Post-earnings announcement drift: Bounds on profitability for the marginal investor, Financial Review, 46, 4, pp. 513-539, (2011); Bautin, Mikhail, International sentiment analysis for news and blogs, pp. 19-26, (2008); Chandrasekaran, Dhivya, Evolution of Semantic Similarity-A Survey, ACM Computing Surveys, 54, 2, (2022); Coleman, Meri, A computer readability formula designed for machine scoring, Journal of Applied Psychology, 60, 2, pp. 283-284, (1975); Collins-Thompson, Kevyn, Computational assessment of text readability: A survey of current and future research, ITL - International Journal of Applied Linguistics (Belgium), 165, 2, pp. 97-135, (2014); Edm, (2021); Educational Research Bulletin, (1948)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc","J.P.

We first explore diverse pairings of generative model forecasts and objective functions used for portfolio optimization, which are evaluated using performance-attribution models based on least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO). We illustrate our approach using extensive simulations of crypto-currency portfolios, and we show that the portfolios constructed using the vine-copula generative model and the Sharpe-ratio objective function consistently outperform. To accommodate a wide array of investment strategies, we further investigate portfolio blending and propose a general framework for evaluating and combining investment strategies. We employ an extension of the multi-armed bandit framework and use value models and policy models to construct eclectic blended portfolios based on past performance. We consider similarity and optimality measures for value models and employ probability-matching (“blending”) and a greedy algorithm (“switching”) for policy models. The eclectic portfolios are also evaluated using LASSO models. We show that the value model utilizing cosine similarity and logit optimality consistently delivers robust superior performances. The extent of outperformance by eclectic portfolios over their benchmarks significantly surpasses that achieved by individual generative model-based portfolios over their respective benchmarks. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cryptocurrency; Generative model; Multi-armed bandit; Portfolio blending; Portfolio construction","","","","We thank Mr. Linghao Huang for his help in validating the DCC-GARCH model as well as Mr. Kaihao Chen and Mr. Xuxin Gao for their help in validating backtest processes.

Models trained on historical data often struggle to adapt to the latest market styles, as the patterns they have learned may no longer hold true over time. To alleviate this issue, the recently popularized concept of In-Context learning has provided us with valuable insights. In this approach, large language models (LLMs) are exposed to multiple examples of input-label pairs, also known as demonstrations, as part of the prompt before performing a task on an unseen example. By thoroughly analyzing these demonstrations, LLMs can uncover potential patterns and effectively adapt to new tasks. Building upon this concept, we propose a Context-Informed drift-aware method for Stock Prediction (CISP), which continually adjusts to the latest market styles and offers more accurate predictions. Our proposed method consists of two key parts. Firstly, we introduce a straightforward and efficient technique for designing demonstrations that aggregate current market information, thereby indicating the prevailing stock market style. Secondly, we incorporate a prediction module with dynamic parameters, allowing it to appropriately adjust its model parameters based on the market patterns embedded in the aforementioned demonstrations. Through extensive experiments conducted on real-world stock market datasets, our approach consistently outperforms the most advanced existing methods for stock prediction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Context-Informed; Drift-Aware; Stock Prediction","Commerce; Deep learning; Financial markets; Forecasting; Learning systems; Concept drifts; Context learning; Context-informed; Drift-aware; Dynamic nature; Exposed to; Historical data; In contexts; Language model; Stock predictions; Demonstrations","","","This work is supported in part by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (61972219 and 62171248), the Science and Technology Program of Shenzhen (JCYJ20220818101012025), the Research and Development Program of Shenzhen (JCYJ20190813174403598), the Overseas Research Cooperation Fund of Tsinghua Shenzhen International Graduate School (HW2021013), and the Key Project of Peng Cheng Laboratory (PCL2021A07 and PCL2023AS4-1).","Do Realized Skewness and Kurtosis Predict the Cross Section of Equity Returns, (2011); Cross Sectional Analysis of the Swedish Stock Market, (2002); An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling, (2018); Brown, Tom B., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020-December, (2020); Xgboost Extreme Gradient Boosting, (2015); Chen, Wei, A novel graph convolutional feature based convolutional neural network for stock trend prediction, Information Sciences, 556, pp. 67-94, (2021); Dey, Rahul, Gate-variants of Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) neural networks, Midwest Symposium on Circuits and Systems, 2017-August, pp. 1597-1600, (2017); Ding, Daizong, Modeling extreme events in time series prediction, pp. 1114-1122, (2019); Ding, Qianggang, Hierarchical multi-scale Gaussian transformer for stock movement prediction, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2021-January, pp. 4640-4646, (2020); A Survey for in Context Learning, (2022)","","Association for Computing Machinery","ACM SIGIR; ACM SIGWEB","32nd ACM International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management, CIKM 2023","","Birmingham","193792","","9798400701245","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85178104550"

It has been successfully employed in financial market prediction, health issues, customer analytics, commercial valuation assessment, brand marketing, politics, crime prediction, and emergency management. Many of the published studies have focused on sentiment analysis of Twitter messages, mainly because a large and diverse population expresses opinions about almost any topic daily on this platform. This paper proposes a comprehensive review of the multifaceted reality of sentiment analysis in social networks. We not only review the existing methods for sentiment analysis in social networks from an academic perspective, but also explore new aspects such as temporal dynamics, causal relationships, and applications in industry. We also study domains where these techniques have been applied, and discuss the practical applicability of emerging Artificial Intelligence methods. This paper emphasizes the importance of temporal characterization and causal effects in sentiment analysis in social networks, and explores their applications in different contexts such as stock market value, politics, and cyberbullying in educational centers. A strong interest from industry in this discipline can be inferred by the intense activity we observe in the field of intellectual protection, with more than 8,000 patents issued on the topic in only five years. This interest compares positively with the effort from academia, with more than 2,300 articles published in 15 years. But these papers are unevenly split across domains: there is a strong presence in marketing, politics, economics, and health, but less activity in other domains such as emergencies. Regarding the techniques employed, traditional techniques such as dictionaries, neural networks, or Support Vector Machines are widely represented. In contrast, we could still not find a comparable representation of advanced state-of-the-art techniques such as Transformers-based systems like BERT, T5, T0++, or GPT-2/3. This reality is consistent with the results found by the authors of this work, where computationally expensive tools such as GPT-3 are challenging to apply to achieve competitive results compared to those from simpler, lighter and more conventional techniques. These results, together with the interest shown by industry and academia, suggest that there is still ample room for research opportunities on domains, techniques and practical applications, and we expect to keep observing a sustained cadence in the number of published papers, patents and commercial tools made available. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Causal rule predictions; Causality; Professional and academic methodologies; Reproducibility studies; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Temporal sentiment analysis; Twitter","Commerce; Financial markets; Forecasting; Patents and inventions; Risk management; Social aspects; Support vector machines; Causal rule prediction; Causality; Professional and academic methodology; Reproducibilities; Reproducibility study; Sentiment analysis; Social media; Temporal sentiment analyse; Twitter","","","This work is partly supported by research grants miHeart RisBi (PID2019-104356RB-C42), miHeart-DaBa (PID2019104356RB-C43), BigTheory (PID2019-106623RB-C41), from Agencia Estatal de Investigacion of Science and In-́ novation Ministry and cofunded by FEDER funding.

Some traditional methods of problem analysis begin to fail. Complexity science is needed to study and solve problems from the perspective of complex systems. As a complex system full of volatility and uncertainty, price fluctuations have attracted wide attention from researchers. Therefore, through a literature review, this paper analyzes the research on complex theories on price prediction. The following conclusions are drawn: (1) The price forecast receives widespread attention year by year, and the number of published articles also shows a rapid rising trend. (2) The hybrid model can achieve higher prediction accuracy than the single model. (3) The complexity of models is increasing. In the future, the more complex methods will be applied to price forecast, including AI technologies such as LLM. (4) Crude-oil prices and stock prices will continue to be the focus of research, with carbon prices, gold prices, Bitcoin, and others becoming new research hotspots. The innovation of this research mainly includes the following three aspects: (1) The whole analysis of all the articles on price prediction using mathematical models in the past 10 years rather than the analysis of a single field such as oil price or stock price. (2) Classify the research methods of price forecasting in different fields, and found the common problems of price forecasting in different fields (including data processing methods and model selection, etc.), which provide references for different researchers to select price forecasting models. (3) Use VOSviewer to analyze the hot words appearing in recent years according to the timeline, find the research trend, and provide references for researchers to choose the future research direction. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","algorithm; chaos; complexity; fluctuate; mathematic; price; volatility","","","","This research was funded by Tianjin Philosophy and Social Science Planning Project, fund number TJGL22-015.","Wu, Fang, The equilibrium, complexity analysis and control in epiphytic supply chain with product horizontal diversification, Nonlinear Dynamics, 93, 4, pp. 2145-2158, (2018); Ma, Junhai, A time-based pricing game in a competitive vehicle market regarding the intervention of carbon emission reduction, Energy Policy, 142, (2020); Wu, Fang, The complex evolution of information quality improvement in competitive market, RAIRO - Operations Research, 57, 2, pp. 351-369, (2023); Ma, Junhai, Complexity and Hopf bifurcation analysis on a kind of fractional-order IS-LM macroeconomic system, International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 26, 11, (2016); Wu, Fang, Research Trend, Logical Structure and Outlook on Complex Economic Game, Mathematics, 11, 5, (2023); Ma, Junhai, Dynamic Pricing Game under Different Channel Power Structures in a Closed-Loop Supply Chain, International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 30, 4, (2020); Ma, Junhai, Bullwhip effect and complexity analysis in a multi-channel supply chain considering price game with discount sensitivity, International Journal of Production Research, 57, 17, pp. 5432-5452, (2019); Ma, Junhai, Studying the Complexity of Multichannel Supply Chain with Different Power Structures under Carbon Subsidy Policy, International Journal of Bifurcation and Chaos, 31, 11, (2021); Ma, Junhai, Pricing strategy and coordination of automobile manufacturers based on government intervention and carbon emission reduction, Energy Policy, 148, (2021); Fan, Xinghua, Chaotic characteristic identification for carbon price and an multi-layer perceptron network prediction model, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 8, pp. 3945-3952, (2015)","","Multidisciplinary Digital Publishing Institute (MDPI)","","","","","","22277390","","","","English","Review","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85164935592"

Analyzing the factors affecting price volatility is of great significance for policymakers to formulate regulations, for financial institutions to control financial risks and for investors to improve their investment returns. We study the impact of geopolitical risk on the price volatility of coal, copper, crude oil, gold, and iron ore in the Chinese futures market. The paper uses the Geopolitical Risk (GPR) index, the Geopolitical Threat (GPT) sub-index and the Geopolitical Action (GPA) sub-index developed by Caldara and Iacoviello to measure geopolitical risk in broader sense. We utilize the closing prices of the most recently expired futures contracts from their starting trading date to 1 August 2022 to determine volatility represented by conditional variance. The GARCH and CGARCH models are built with the help of the Kalman filtering method and a TVP-VAR-SV model. The results of GARCH model show that geopolitical risk significantly increases the price volatility of coal, iron ore, and crude oil futures; significantly decreases the price volatility of gold; and has no significant effect on the price volatility of copper futures. By CGARCH model, we illustrate that geopolitical risk significantly increases the overall volatility, persistent volatility, and temporary volatility of crude oil; significantly increases the overall volatility and temporary volatility of coal and iron ore futures; significantly decreases the overall volatility and persistent volatility of gold futures; and has no significant impact on all three types of volatility of copper futures prices. The results of the Kalman filter analysis uncover that the response of each commodity volatility to changes in geopolitical risk increases when geopolitical risk is high. Additionally, geopolitical risk has the most effect on the price volatility of copper and crude oil with high external dependence.

Yet the sinister specter of a technology that has hidden and unmanageable attributes that might be harmful to society looms in the background, as well as the likelihood that it will never deliver on the purported promise of artificial general intelligence (AGI). Currently, the prospects for the development of AI and AGI are more a matter of opinion than based on a consistent methodological approach. Thus, there is a need to take a step back to develop a general framework from which to evaluate current AI efforts, which also permits the determination of the limits to its future prospects as AGI. To gain insight into the development of a general framework, a key question needs to be resolved: what is the connection between human intelligence and machine intelligence? This is the question that needs a response because humans are at the center of AI creation and realize that, without an understanding of how we become what we become, we have no chance of finding a solution. This work proposes info-autopoiesis, the self-referential, recursive, and interactive process of self-production of information, as the needed general framework. Info-autopoiesis shows how the key ingredient of information is fundamental to an insightful resolution to this crucial question and allows predictions as to the present and future of AGI. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Claude Shannon; communication; Gregory Bateson; info-autopoiesis; information; semantic; syntactic","","","","","Why Everyone is Talking about the A I Text Generator Released by an Elon Musk Backed Lab, (2020); How to Use Dall E 2 to Turn Your Creative Visions into AI Generated Art Zdnet 2023; Meet Dall E the A I that Draws Anything at Your Command New York Times, (2022); Bbc News, (2023); AI Generated Images of Pope Francis in Puffer Jacket Fool the Internet, (2023); Brilliance and Weirdness of Chatgpt, (2022); undefined, (2023); Superintelligence Paths Dangers Strategies, (2014); Time, (2023); Myth of Artificial Intelligence Why Computers Cant Think the Way We do, (2021)","","MDPI","","","","","","2073431X","","","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85160215555"

This paper explores the novel use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for explainable financial time series forecasting, addressing challenges in cross-sequence reasoning, multi-modal data integration, and result interpretation that are inherent in traditional approaches. Focusing on NASDAQ-100 stocks, we utilize public historical stock data, company metadata, and economic/financial news. Our experiments employ GPT-4 for zero-shot/few-shot inference and Open LLaMA for instruction-based fine-tuning. The study demonstrates LLMs' ability to generate well-reasoned decisions by leveraging cross-sequence information and extracting insights from text and price time series. We show that our LLM-based approach outperforms classic ARMA-GARCH and gradient-boosting tree models. Furthermore, fine-tuned public LLMs, such as Open-LLaMA, can generate reasonable and explainable forecasts, although they underperform compared to GPT-4. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Data integration; Decision making; Financial data processing; Financial markets; Forecasting; Industrial research; Time series; Active area; Decision policy; Financial time series; Financial time series forecasting; Language model; Machine-learning; Policy formation; Risks management; Strategic decision making; Temporal Data; Risk management","","","","Aghabozorgi, Saeed Reza, Time-series clustering - A decade review, Information Systems, 53, pp. 16-38, (2015); Handbook of Financial Time Series, (2009); International Journal of Advanced Networking and Applications, (2012); Bahrammirzaee, Arash, A comparative survey of artificial intelligence applications in finance: Artificial neural networks, expert system and hybrid intelligent systems, Neural Computing and Applications, 19, 8, pp. 1165-1195, (2010); Brown, Tom B., Language models are few-shot learners, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2020-December, (2020); Language Models are Few Shot Learners, (2020); Chen, Cathy W.S., A review of threshold time series models in finance, Statistics and its Interface, 4, 2, pp. 167-182, (2011); Chen, Zheng, Correlated Anomaly Detection from Large Streaming Data, pp. 982-992, (2018); Cheng, Dawei, Financial time series forecasting with multi-modality graph neural network, Pattern Recognition, 121, (2022); Vicuna an Open Source Chatbot Impressing Gpt 4 with 90 Chatgpt Quality, (2023)","Wang, M.; Zitouni, I.","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","","2023 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing: Industry Track, EMNLP 2023","","Singapore","196541","","9788891760684","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85184667082"

In contrast to the bit-level switching, in which transistors achieved energy efficiency due to geometrical scaling, higher energy is expended both at the at the instructions and simulations levels of an application. Additionally, the analysis based on AI/ML Accelerators indicate that changes in architectures using an older semiconductor technology node have comparable energy efficiency with a different architecture using a newer technology. Further comparisons of the energy in computing systems with the thermodynamic and biological limits, indicate that there is a 27-36 orders of magnitude higher energy requirements for total simulation of an application.

Our experiments show that (1) synthetic financial time series can be effectively generated by our method; (2) the distribution characteristics of synthetic time series generated by the method are closer to the initial ones in comparison with Fourier Flows and QuantGAN; (3) training the forecasting model on the synthetics generated by the proposed method (Fourier Flows model is used within it) can reduce the forecasting error on the real-world series. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN); normalising flows; regime clustering; synthetic time series; time series generation","","","","This research is financially supported by the Russian Science Foundation, Agreement 17-71-30029 (https://rscf.ru/en/project/17-71-30029/), with cofinancing of Bank Saint Petersburg.","Berat Sezer, Omer, Financial time series forecasting with deep learning: A systematic literature review: 2005–2019, Applied Soft Computing, 90, (2020); Bhowmik, Roni, Stock market volatility and return analysis: A systematic literature review, Entropy, 22, 5, (2020); Lu, Wenjie, A CNN-BiLSTM-AM method for stock price prediction, Neural Computing and Applications, 33, 10, pp. 4741-4753, (2021); Parot, Alejandro, Using Artificial Neural Networks to forecast Exchange Rate, including VAR-VECM residual analysis and prediction linear combination, Intelligent Systems in Accounting, Finance and Management, 26, 1, pp. 3-15, (2019); Assefa, Samuel A., Generating synthetic data in finance: Opportunities, challenges and pitfalls, (2020); Krollner, Bjoern, Financial time series forecasting with machine learning techniques: A survey, pp. 25-30, (2010); Pardo, Fernando De Meer, Mitigating Overfitting on Financial Datasets with Generative Adversarial Networks, Journal of Financial Data Science, 2, 1, pp. 76-85, (2020); Conditional Synthetic Financial Time Series with Generative Adversarial Networks, (2022); Chakraborti, Anirban, Econophysics review: I.

With the growth of the cryptocurrency market and obscurity around it, a new form of scam, namely ""Collusion Scam"" has emerged as a dominant force within YouTube's comment space. Unlike typical scams and spams, collusion scams employ a cunning persuasion strategy, using the facade of genuine social interactions within comment threads to create an aura of trust and success to entrap innocent users. In this research, we collect 1,174 such collusion scam threads and perform a detailed analysis, which is tailored towards the successful detection of these scams. We find that utilization of the collusion dynamics can provide an accuracy of 96.67% and an F1-score of 93.04%. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust predictive power of metadata associated with these threads and user channels, which act as compelling indicators of collusion scams. Finally, we show that modern LLM, like chatGPT, can effectively detect collusion scams without the need for any training. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","F1 scores; New forms; Persuasion strategy; Predictive power; Repeated measures; Social interactions; YouTube; Electronic money","","","This research was supported in part by grant ARO W911NF-20-1-0254.

State-of-the-art performance for irregular time series generation has been previously obtained by training these models adversarially as GANs. However, as typical for GAN architectures, training is notoriously unstable, often suffers from mode collapse, and requires specialised techniques such as weight clipping and gradient penalty to mitigate these issues. In this paper, we introduce a novel class of scoring rules on pathspace based on signature kernels and use them as objective for training Neural SDEs non-adversarially. By showing strict properness of such kernel scores and consistency of the corresponding estimators, we provide existence and uniqueness guarantees for the minimiser. With this formulation, evaluating the generator-discriminator pair amounts to solving a system of linear path-dependent PDEs which allows for memory-efficient adjoint-based backpropagation. Moreover, because the proposed kernel scores are well-defined for paths with values in infinite dimensional spaces of functions, our framework can be easily extended to generate spatiotemporal data. Our procedure permits conditioning on a rich variety of market conditions and significantly outperforms alternative ways of training Neural SDEs on a variety of tasks including the simulation of rough volatility models, the conditional probabilistic forecasts of real-world forex pairs where the conditioning variable is an observed past trajectory, and the mesh-free generation of limit order book dynamics. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Continous time; Existence and uniqueness; Generative model; Irregular time series; Memory efficient; Properness; Scoring rules; Sequential data; State-of-the-art performance; Time-series generation","","","ML was supported by the EPSRC grant EP/S026347/1.

The shared task involves three classification subtasks, each featuring low-resource datasets with a limited number of examples per label. The first subtask focuses on predicting the magnitude of an influencer. The second subtask involves classifying the interest of the influencer. Lastly, the third subtask focuses on predicting the intent of the tweet, with the aim of identifying its underlying purpose or motivation. Our system exploits pre-trained language models by adapting two distinct training frameworks: traditional fine-tuning and entailment-based fine-tuning. The traditional fine-tuning approach trains a transformer encoder to predict the class of each tweet. In contrast, the entailment-based approach utilizes a model pre-trained for the NLI task and further trains it using the task data by reframing the classification problem as an entailment problem. Although the former is suitable for ample labeled data, the entailment-based approach is more effective in low-resource scenarios. We found that, in the tasks’ data, entailment-based and traditional fine-tuning schemes showed outstanding performance, we propose an ensembling technique that combines the strengths of both strategies through a soft-voting approach over the traditional fine-tuning predictions and the entailment-probabilities of the entailment approach. Furthermore, we also employ a Data Augmentation strategy by prompting ChatGPT to generate another synthetic tweet for each of the tweets in the dataset. Our submitted system ranked first for the second subtask, and obtained highly competitive results in the other two. Overall, our team obtained the first place in the shared task, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","data augmentation; ensemble; fine tuning; natural language inference; pretrained language models; text classification; transformers","Computational linguistics; Forecasting; Natural language processing systems; Text processing; Data augmentation; Ensemble; Fine tuning; Language inference; Language model; Natural language inference; Natural languages; Pretrained language model; Text classification; Transformer; Classification (of information)","","","Funding text 1: (INAOE) for the computer resources provided through the INAOE Supercomputing Laboratory’s Deep Learning Platform for Language Technologies (Laboratorio de Supercómputo: Plataforma de Aprendizaje Profundo) with the project ""Identification of Aggressive and Offensive text through specialized BERT’s ensembles"" and CIMAT Bajio Supercomputing Laboratory (#300832).

We demonstrate that pairwise lead-lag interactions between time series can be viewed as a directed organization. There is a practical calculation for locating the lead-lag bundle set with significant pairwise imbalance in this instance. We investigate various options for the system's directed network clustering models and pairwise lead lag metric. Daily cost data on actual US values and the constructed generative model of the multivariate lead-lag time series framework are used to test the system. Using the pairwise lead-lag metric and directed tissue clustering computations, we offer a method for identifying lead-lag clusters in multivariate time series without a doubt. We demonstrate that the stationary tissue of pairwise lead-lag interactions between time series can be conceptualized as a directed tissue and that a suitable computation exists for locating the lead-lag groups in this type of tissue that have significant pairwise imbalances. increase. © 2024 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Automated AI; clustering; Equity market; lead-lag prediction; Multivariate time series","Artificial intelligence; Commerce; Digital storage; Financial markets; Tissue; Automated AI; Clusterings; Equity markets; Lead-lag; Lead-lag prediction; Multivariate time series; Practical calculation; Prediction-based; Time lag; Times series; Time series","","","","Asness, Clifford S., Value and Momentum Everywhere, Journal of Finance, 68, 3, pp. 929-985, (2013); Review of Financial Studies, (1995); Basnarkov, Lasko, Lead–lag relationships in foreign exchange markets, Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications, 539, (2020); Batson, Joshua D., Spectral sparsification of graphs: Theory and algorithms, Communications of the ACM, 56, 8, pp. 87-94, (2013); Biely, Christoly, Random matrix ensembles of time-lagged correlation matrices: Derivation of eigenvalue spectra and analysis of financial time-series, Quantitative Finance, 8, 7, pp. 705-722, (2008); Billio, Monica, Econometric measures of connectedness and systemic risk in the finance and insurance sectors, Journal of Financial Economics, 104, 3, pp. 535-559, (2012); Biometrika, (1952); Review of Financial Studies, (1993); Camilleri, Silvio John, Do stock markets lead or lag macroeconomic variables?

AI technology has been challenging for human cognition over the past decade. In recent years，natural language processing techniques can be focused on more. ChatGPT，as a case of emerging generative AI technology，is launched in December of 2022. ChatGPT，as an advanced language model，is commonly used on the basis of its a）larger model sizes，b）advanced pretraining methods，c）faster computing resources，and d）more language processing tasks. This ChatGPT-related literature review is focused on its（1）public awareness and application status，（2）characteristics，（3）mechanisms，（4）scalability，（5）challenges and limitations，（6）future development and application prospects，and （7）improvements of GPT-4 relative to ChatGPT. Cognitive computing and AI-based ChatGPT can be as a sort of language model in terms of the Transformer architecture and Generative Pre-Training（GPT）. This GPT-trained model can be related to natural language processing，which can predict the probability distribution of the next token using a multi-layer Transformer to generate natural language text. It can be outreached by training the learned language patterns on a large corpus of text. The OpenAI’s language model has shown a significant improvement in their level of intelligence from GPT-1（117 million parameters）in 2018 to GPT-3（175 billion parameters）in 2020. The language processing and generation capabilities of GPT have been improving dramatically in terms of consistent optimization like its 1）model size，2）generative models，and 3）self-supervised learning. Thereafter，reinforcement learning-based InstructGPT is originated from Human Feedback and such probability of infeasible，untrue，and biased outputs can be significantly reduced in January 2022. In December 2022，ChatGPT is introduced as the sister model of InstructGPT. ChatGPT is not only add InstructGPT-based chat attributes，and a test version is opened to the public. The core technologies of ChatGPT can be linked to 1）reinforcement learning from human feedback（RLHF），2）supervised fine-tuning（SFT），3）instruction fine-tnning（IFT），and 4）chain-of-thought （CoT）as well. ChatGPT has attracked about 100 million active users per month after the launch of two months. In comparison，TikTok took nine months to achieve 100 million monthly active users，and Instagram took two and a half years. According to Similar Web，more than 13 million independent visitors use ChatGPT on average each day in January of 2023，which is more than twice in December of 2022. The leading US new media company Buzzfeed accurately seized the opportunity of ChatGPT and saw its stock price triple in two days. The ChatGPT-derived impact shows its potential preference for consumers. The ChatGPT can play mulitiple roles for such domain like clinics，translation，official administrations，and programming tasks. Such extensive application of ChatGPT is still to be developed. However，while ChatGPT has the potential for widespread application in various industries，it cannot be universally applied to all industries. For example，as certain industrial production processes typically rely on digitalization and do not necessitate the handling of human language，natural language processing techniques may not be required. Furthermore，various other factors，such as legal restrictions and data privacy concerns，may also impinge upon the application of natural language processing technologies within certain industries. For industries that require the processing of sensitive information，such as the healthcare industry，natural language processing technologies may need to comply with strict legal regulations to ensure data privacy and security. In addition to industry-specific reasons，it should be noted that ChatGPT has not yet achieved perfection in natural language processing tasks. In summary，as a phenomenal and technological product，AI-generated ChatGPT’s potentials are beneficial for textual and multi-modal AIGC applications to a certain extent，and it may have an impact on the a）survival of corporations，b）competition among countries，and c）entire social structure. However，the current various positive evaluations of ChatGPT can only be seen as a phenomenon of good rain after a long drought，and it cannot change the fact that ChatGPT is a questions and answers（Q&A）solution based on prior knowledge and models. It is required to be acknowledged that ChatGPT does not have its true recognition，intention，and creativity yet，and its true intelligence need to be tackled further. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","artificial intelligence generated content （AIGC）; artificial intelligence（AI）; ChatGPT; deep learning; natural language processing","","","","Natural Natural Science Foundation of China（62206104，62225603）","Dota 2 with Large Scale Deep Reinforcement Learning, (2019); Corr, (2020); Devlin, Jacob, BERT: Pre-training of deep bidirectional transformers for language understanding, 1, pp. 4171-4186, (2019); Du, Nan, GLaM: Efficient Scaling of Language Models with Mixture-of-Experts, Proceedings of Machine Learning Research, 162, pp. 5547-5569, (2022); Fedus, William, Switch Transformers: Scaling to Trillion Parameter Models with Simple and Efficient Sparsity, Journal of Machine Learning Research, 23, (2022); Jumper, John M., Highly accurate protein structure prediction with AlphaFold, Nature, 596, 7873, pp. 583-589, (2021); Krizhevsky, Alex, ImageNet classification with deep convolutional neural networks, Communications of the ACM, 60, 6, pp. 84-90, (2017); Training Language Models to Follow Instructions with Human Feedback, (2022); Improving Language Understanding by Generative Pre Training, (2018); Rombach, Robin, High-Resolution Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models, Proceedings of the IEEE Computer Society Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2022-June, pp. 10674-10685, (2022)","","Editorial and Publishing Board of JIG","","","","","","10068961","","","","Chinese","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85162903296"

However, the exponential growth of financial information and the different polarities of sentiment that other sectors or stakeholders may have on the same information has led to the need for new technologies that automatically collect and classify large volumes of information quickly and easily for each stakeholder. In this scenario, we conduct a targeted sentiment analysis that can automatically extract the main economic target from financial texts and obtain the polarity of a text towards such main economic target, other companies and society in general. To this end, we have compiled a novel corpus of financial tweets and news headlines in Spanish, constituting a valuable resource for the Spanish-focused research community. In addition, we have carried out a performance comparison of different Spanish-specific large language models, with MarIA and BETO achieving the best results. Our best result has an overall performance of 76.04%, 74.16%, and 68.07% in macro F1-score for the sentiment classification towards the main economic target, society, and other companies, respectively, and an accuracy of 69.74% for target detection.

While generative adversarial network (GAN), conditional GAN (CGAN), and autoencoding CGAN (ACGAN) have been explored to generate financial time series and extract features that can help portfolio analysis. The limitation of the CGAN or ACGAN framework stands in putting too much emphasis on generating series and finding the internal trends of the series rather than predicting the future trends. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid approach on conditional GAN based on deep generative models that learns the internal trend of historical data while modeling market uncertainty and future trends. We evaluate the model on several real-world datasets from both the US and Europe markets, and show that the proposed HybridCGAN and HybridACGAN models lead to better portfolio allocation compared to the existing Markowitz, CGAN, and ACGAN approaches. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Autoencoding conditional GAN (ACGAN); Conditional GAN; Hybrid CGAN; Markowitz framework; Portfolio analysis and allocation; Sharpe ratio; Synthetic series","","","","","Review of Financial Studies, (1991); Bollerslev, Tim, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Journal of Econometrics, 31, 3, pp. 307-327, (1986); Generative Adversarial Networks in Finance an Overview, (2021); Econometrica, (1987); Real Valued Medical Time Series Generation with Recurrent Conditional Gans, (2017); Goodfellow, Ian J., Generative adversarial nets, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 3, January, pp. 2672-2680, (2014); Green, Richard C., When Will Mean‐Variance Efficient Portfolios Be Well Diversified?, Journal of Finance, 47, 5, pp. 1785-1809, (1992); Gulrajani, Ishaan, Improved training of wasserstein GANs, Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 2017-December, pp. 5768-5778, (2017); Huang, Wei, Forecasting stock market movement direction with support vector machine, Computers and Operations Research, 32, 10, pp. 2513-2522, (2005); Methods of Operations Research, (1981)","Joby, P.P.; Balas, V.E.; Palanisamy, R.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH","","3rd International Conference on IoT Based Control Networks and Intelligent Systems, ICICNIS 2022","","Kottayam","285079","23673389; 23673370","9783031950162; 9789819657506; 9783032004406; 9783031967740; 9783031926105; 9789819667208; 9789819662999; 9789819641505; 9783032000705; 9783031999963","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85141738844"

In this paper, we propose a method for the detection of lead–lag clusters of time series in multivariate systems. We demonstrate that the web of pairwise lead–lag relationships between time series can be helpfully construed as a directed network, for which there exist suitable algorithms for the detection of pairs of lead–lag clusters with high pairwise imbalance. Within our framework, we consider a number of choices for the pairwise lead–lag metric and directed network clustering model components. Our framework is validated on both a synthetic generative model for multivariate lead–lag time series systems and daily real-world US equity prices data. We showcase that our method is able to detect statistically significant lead–lag clusters in the US equity market. We study the nature of these clusters in the context of the empirical finance literature on lead–lag relations, and demonstrate how these can be used for the construction of predictive financial signals. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Clustering; Directed networks; Financial markets; Flow imbalance; High-dimensional time series; Lead–lag; Unsupervised learning","Chemical detection; Commerce; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Real time systems; Unsupervised learning; Clusterings; Directed network; Flow imbalances; High-dimensional; High-dimensional time series; Higher-dimensional; Lead-lag; Multivariate time series; Network Clustering; Times series; Time series","","","SB is supported by the EPSRC CDT in Modern Statistics and Statistical Machine Learning (EP/S023151/1) and The Alan Turing Institute\u2019s Finance and Economics Programme.

In general, ML models have been shown powerful when trained with large amounts of data. In practice, the time-series nature of financial datasets limits the effective amount of data available to train, validate and retrain models since special care must be taken not to include future data in any way. In this setting, we develop deep generative models to produce synthetic time-series data, enhancing the amount of data available for training predictive models. Synthetic data obtained this way replicates the distribution properties of real historical data, leads to better performance, and enables thorough validation of predictive models for price signals.

Computational technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) seemed to become ubiquitous in 2020 and have been increasingly applied as scientists worked from home and were separated from the laboratory and their colleagues. This shift may be more permanent as the future of molecule design across different industries will increasingly require machine learning models for design and optimization of molecules as they become “designed by AI”. AI and machine learning has essentially become a commodity within the pharmaceutical industry. This perspective will briefly describe our personal opinions of how machine learning has evolved and is being applied to model different molecule properties that crosses industries in their utility and ultimately suggests the potential for tight integration of AI into equipment and automated experimental pipelines. It will also describe how many groups have implemented generative models covering different architectures, for de novo design of molecules. We also highlight some of the companies at the forefront of using AI to demonstrate how machine learning has impacted and influenced our work.

Due to their complex nature, financial algorithms and fintech frameworks require vast amounts of data to accurately respond to market fluctuations. This data availability is tied to the daily market evolution, so it is impossible to accelerate its acquisition. In this article, we discuss several solutions for augmenting financial datasets via synthesizing realistic time-series with the help of generative models. This problem is complex, since financial time series present very specific properties, e.g., fat-tail distribution, cross-correlation between different stocks, specific autocorrelation, cluster volatility and so on. In particular, we propose solutions for capturing cross-correlations between different stocks and for transitioning from fixed to variable length time-series without resorting to sequence modeling networks, and adapt various network architectures, e.g., fully connected and convolutional GANs, variational autoencoders, and generative moment matching networks. Finally, we tackle the problem of evaluating the quality of synthetic financial time-series.

The current mainstream approaches usually apply financial texts and some corresponding stock price information to predict the stock price movement. However, the current methods usually suffer from two shortcomings: (1) To reduce the stochasticity in the stock price and financial text information, some researchers adopt generative models to better treat the stochasticity while enduring the overfitting problem during training. (2) Although the current state-of-the-art methods based on the generative adversarial network have been proposed to reduce the overfitting, they only concentrate on the overfitting problem of the stock price information and neglect the above problem of financial text information with higher stochasticity. In this paper, we propose a self-regulated generative adversarial network by combining the generative adversarial network and cooperative network for the stock price movement prediction. Furthermore, the proposed model can effectively reduce the stochasticity and overfitting problems simultaneously for the stock price and the financial text information. The experimental results on the currently commonly used stock dataset based on tweets confirm that the proposed method can achieve the novelly state-of-the-art performance compared with some current advances. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Cooperative network; Generative adversarial network; Pre-trained language model; Stock price movement prediction","Financial markets; Forecasting; Motion estimation; 'current; Cooperative networks; Language model; Over fitting problem; Pre-trained language model; Price information; Stochasticity; Stock price; Stock price movement predictions; Text information; Generative adversarial networks","","","This work is supported by the National Nature Science Foundation of China (No. 61876159 , No. 61806172 , No. 62076116 , No. U1705286 ), the China Postdoctoral Science Foundation Grant (No. 2019M652257 ).","Hu, Ziniu, Listening to chaotic whispers: A deep learning framework for news-oriented Stock trend prediction, 2018-Febuary, pp. 261-269, (2018); Livieris, Ioannis E., Forecasting stock price index movement using a constrained deep neural network training algorithm, Intelligent Decision Technologies, 14, 3, pp. 313-323, (2020); Adam, Klaus, Stock Market Volatility and Learning, Journal of Finance, 71, 1, pp. 33-82, (2016); Xu, Yumo, Stock movement prediction from tweets and historical prices, 1, pp. 1970-1979, (2018); Long, Wen, A new graphic kernel method of stock price trend prediction based on financial news semantic and structural similarity, Expert Systems with Applications, 118, pp. 411-424, (2019); Ming, Felix, Stock Market Prediction from WSJ: Text Mining via Sparse Matrix Factorization, Proceedings - IEEE International Conference on Data Mining, ICDM, 2015-January, January, pp. 430-439, (2014); Ding, Xiao, Deep learning for event-driven stock prediction, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2015-January, pp. 2327-2333, (2015); A Random Walk Down Wall Street, (1996); Feng, Fuli, Enhancing stock movement prediction with adversarial training, IJCAI International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2019-August, pp. 5843-5849, (2019); Liu, Yang, Stock price movement prediction from financial news with deep learning and knowledge graph embedding, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 11016 LNAI, pp. 102-113, (2018)","","Elsevier B.V.","","","","","","09507051","","KNSYE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85129477726"

This paper presents a novel sequence to sequence based framework for forecasting people's needs during disasters using social media and weather data. It consists of two Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models, one of which encodes input sequences of weather information and the other plays as a conditional decoder that decodes the encoded vector and forecasts the survivors' needs. Case studies using data collected during Hurricane Sandy in 2012, Hurricane Harvey and Hurricane Irma in 2017 demonstrate that the proposed approach outperformed the statistical language model n-gram, LSTM generative model, and convolutional neural network (CNN) based model.

Due to the various interconnected aspects, predicting these markets is a difficult endeavour that necessitates a thorough as well as efficient feature selection procedure to discover the highest useful aspects. Stock price changes are also influenced by previous trading days' movements, which is a time series problem. In stock forecasting, feature selection techniques are commonly used, although most known systems use a single feature selection methodology that probably can neglect some key notions about the regression function that is at the root of the problem relating the variables for input and output. This study employs an artificial neural network (ANN) based generative model to forecast pricing changes in the future by combining features preferred by different feature picking strategies to build an ideal optimal feature group. We begin by calculating an expanded set of 83 technical indicators using day-to-day stock data of six stock indices, and then we normalize them using the Hybrid-Normalization (HN) technique. The important features are selected using various types of feature selection techniques and then considering the common features for the stock movement prediction. For stock trend predictions, we used a variety of classifiers such as Support Vector Machine, K Nearest Neighbour and Artificial Neural Network and. The system was given a performance review after simulations were done on 6 stock indices from various portions of the international market. The outcomes show that joining highlighted features got by various feature choice calculations and taking care of them into a profound generative model beats best in class techniques. © 2023 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Artificial Neural Network; Hybrid Normalization; Intersection Feature selection; K Nearest Neighbour; Stock market indices; Support Vector Machines","Electronic trading; Feature Selection; Financial markets; Forecasting; International trade; Motion estimation; Nearest neighbor search; Neural networks; Features selection; Hybrid normalization; Intersection feature selection; Intersection features; K near neighbor; Nearest-neighbour; Normalisation; Stock market index; Stock movement; Support vectors machine; Support vector machines","","","","Zhong, Xiao, Forecasting daily stock market return using dimensionality reduction, Expert Systems with Applications, 67, pp. 126-139, (2017); Kumari, Binita Aruna, Stock movement prediction using hybrid normalization technique and artificial neural network, International Journal of Advanced Technology and Engineering Exploration, 8, 83, pp. 1336-1350, (2021); Atsalakis, George S., Surveying stock market forecasting techniques - Part II: Soft computing methods, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3 PART 2, pp. 5932-5941, (2009); Gündüz, Hakan, Stock daily return prediction using expanded features and feature selection, Turkish Journal of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences, 25, 6, pp. 4829-4840, (2017); Tsai, Chihfong, Combining multiple feature selection methods for stock prediction: Union, intersection, and multi-intersection approaches, Decision Support Systems, 50, 1, pp. 258-269, (2010); Nguyen, Thien Hai, Topic modeling based sentiment analysis on social media for stock market prediction, 1, pp. 1354-1364, (2015); Fernandez-Lozano, Carlos, Hybrid model based on genetic algorithms and SVM applied to variable selection within fruit juice classification, Scientific World Journal, 2013, (2013); García, Salvador, Advanced nonparametric tests for multiple comparisons in the design of experiments in computational intelligence and data mining: Experimental analysis of power, Information Sciences, 180, 10, pp. 2044-2064, (2010); García, Luís Paulo Faina, Effect of label noise in the complexity of classification problems, Neurocomputing, 160, pp. 108-119, (2015); Sáez, José A., Tackling the problem of classification with noisy data using Multiple Classifier Systems: Analysis of the performance and robustness, Information Sciences, 247, pp. 1-20, (2013)","Singh, V.","Elsevier B.V.","","2022 International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Engineering, ICMLDE 2022","","Dehradun","188151","18770509","9781510849914","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85163759342"

Stock price contains complex, incomplete, and fuzzy information which makes it an extremely difficult task to predict its development trend. Predicting and analysing financial data is a nonlinear, time-dependent problem. With rapid development in machine learning and deep learning, this task can be performed more effectively by a purposely designed network. This paper aims to improve prediction accuracy and minimizing forecasting error loss through deep learning architecture by using Generative Adversarial Networks. It was proposed a generic model consisting of Phase-space Reconstruction (PSR) method for reconstructing price series and Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) which is a combination of two neural networks which are Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) as Generative model and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) as Discriminative model for adversarial training to forecast the stock market. LSTM will generate new instances based on historical basic indicators information and then CNN will estimate whether the data is predicted by LSTM or is real. It was found that the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) has performed well on the enhanced root mean square error to LSTM, as it was 4.35% more accurate in predicting the direction and reduced processing time and RMSE by 78 s and 0.029, respectively. This study provides a better result in the accuracy of the stock index. It seems that the proposed system concentrates on minimizing the root mean square error and processing time and improving the direction prediction accuracy, and provides a better result in the accuracy of the stock index. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Generative adversarial networks; Phase-space reconstruction; Stock market prediction","Commerce; Convolutional neural networks; Electronic trading; Errors; Financial markets; Forecasting; Long short-term memory; Mean square error; Motion estimation; Phase space methods; Convolutional neural network; Deep learning; Phase spaces; Phase-space reconstruction; Prediction accuracy; Processing time; Root mean square errors; Space reconstruction; Stock indices; Stock market prediction; Generative adversarial networks","","","","Arora, Monika, Character level embedding with deep convolutional neural network for text normalization of unstructured data for Twitter sentiment analysis, Social Network Analysis and Mining, 9, 1, (2019); Derakhshan, Ali, Sentiment analysis on stock social media for stock price movement prediction, Engineering Applications of Artificial Intelligence, 85, pp. 569-578, (2019); Göçken, Mustafa, Stock price prediction using hybrid soft computing models incorporating parameter tuning and input variable selection, Neural Computing and Applications, 31, 2, pp. 577-592, (2019); Hoseinzade, Ehsan, CNNpred: CNN-based stock market prediction using a diverse set of variables, Expert Systems with Applications, 129, pp. 273-285, (2019); Jeon, Seungwoo, Pattern graph tracking-based stock price prediction using big data, Future Generation Computer Systems, 80, pp. 171-187, (2018); Li, Xiaodong, Empirical analysis: stock market prediction via extreme learning machine, Neural Computing and Applications, 27, 1, pp. 67-78, (2016); Long, Wen, Deep learning-based feature engineering for stock price movement prediction, Knowledge-Based Systems, 164, pp. 163-173, (2019); Clust Comput, (2018); Ann Oper Res, (2019); Basak, Suryoday, Predicting the direction of stock market prices using tree-based classifiers, North American Journal of Economics and Finance, 47, pp. 552-567, (2019)","","Springer","","","","","","13807501; 15737721","","MTAPF","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Green Accepted Open Access; Green Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85120062109"

A great number of attempts have been conducted to ascertain how news articles influence stock prices. News articles have been reported to contain sentimental and fundamental information that affects stock price fluctuations, and many studies have been conducted to evaluate stock price fluctuations using them as analytical data. However, the limitations in the number of available datasets usually become the hurdle for the model accuracy. This study aims to improve the analytical model’s accuracy by generating news articles using language generation technology. We tested whether the model that used the generated data was better than the trained model with real-world data. The model constructed in this research is a model that evaluates news articles distributed to financial markets based on the price fluctuation rate of stock prices and predicts and evaluates stock price fluctuations. This study labeled based on high-frequency trading data and generated news articles using a large-scale language generation model (GPT-2). Also, we analyzed and verified the effect.

Predicting these markets is a challenging task due to numerous interrelated factors, and needs a complete and efficient feature selection process to identify the most informative factors. As a time series problem, stock price movements are also dependent on movements on its previous trading days. Feature selection techniques have been widely applied in stock forecasting, but existing approaches usually use a single feature selection technique, which may overlook some important assumptions about the underlying regression function linking the input and output variables. In this study, we combine features selected by multiple feature selection techniques to generate an optimal feature subset and then use a deep generative model to predict future price movements. First, we compute an extended set of forty-four technical indicators from daily stock data of eighty-eight stocks and then compute their importance by independently training logistic regression model, support vector machine and random forests. Based on a prespecified threshold, the lowest ranked features are dropped and the rest are grouped into clusters. The variable importance measure is reused to select the most important feature from each cluster to generate the final subset. The input is then fed to a deep generative model comprising of a market signal extractor and an attention mechanism. The market signal extractor recurrently decodes market movement from the latent variables to deal with stochastic nature of the stock data and the attention mechanism discriminates between predictive dependencies of different temporal auxiliary outputs. The results demonstrate that combining features selected by multiple feature selection approaches and using them as input into a deep generative model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Feature selection; Machine learning; Stock trend prediction","Commerce; Decision trees; Deep learning; Financial markets; Forecasting; Logistic regression; Stochastic systems; Support vector machines; Support vector regression; Attention mechanisms; Efficient feature selections; Logistic Regression modeling; Selection techniques; State-of-the-art approach; Stock market forecasting; Stock price movements; Variable importances; Feature extraction","","","","Adebiyi, Ayodele Ariyo, Comparison of ARIMA and artificial neural networks models for stock price prediction, Journal of Applied Mathematics, 2014, (2014); Atsalakis, George S., Surveying stock market forecasting techniques - Part II: Soft computing methods, Expert Systems with Applications, 36, 3 PART 2, pp. 5932-5941, (2009); Review and Evaluation of Feature Selection Algorithms in Synthetic Problems, (2011); Bollerslev, Tim, Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity, Journal of Econometrics, 31, 3, pp. 307-327, (1986); Breiman, Leo, Random forests, Machine Learning, 45, 1, pp. 5-32, (2001); Smoothing Forecasting and Prediction of Discrete Time Series, (1963); Bustos, Oscar, Stock market movement forecast: A Systematic review, Expert Systems with Applications, 156, (2020); Cai, Qisen, A novel stock forecasting model based on fuzzy time series and genetic algorithm, Procedia Computer Science, 18, pp. 1155-1162, (2013); Finance Markets and Valuation, (2020); Frey, Brendan J., Clustering by passing messages between data points, Science, 315, 5814, pp. 972-976, (2007)","","Elsevier Ltd","","","","","","09574174","","ESAPE","","English","Article","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85097578923"

The results of EDA reveal that the complex patterns within the data can be better captured by discriminative classification models and this was endorsed by performing back-testing on two securities using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Random Forests (RF) as discriminative models against their counterpart Naïve Bayes as a generative model. To enhance the learning process, the new reward loss function is utilized to retrain the ANN with testing on AAPL, IBM, BRENT CRUDE and BTC using auto-trading strategy that serves as the intelligent unit, and the results indicate this loss superiorly outperforms the conventional cross-entropy used in predictive models.

It is estimated that a third of all productivity increases in the U.S. since 1974 have come from information technology,a,4 making it one of the largest contributors to national prosperity. The rise of computers is due to technical successes, but also to the economics forces that fnanced them. Bresnahan and Trajtenberg3 coined the term general purpose technology (GPT) for products, like computers, that have broad technical applicability and where product improvement and market growthcould fuel each other for many decades. But, they also predicted that GPTs could run into challenges at the end of their life cycle: as progress slows, other technologies can displace the GPT in particular niches and undermine this economically reinforcing cycle. We are observing such a transition today as improvements in central processing units (CPUs) slow, and so applications move to specialized processors, for example, graphics processing units (GPUs), which can do fewer things than traditional universal processors, but perform those functions better.

However, most of the existing studies were focused on the prediction of a single stock, ignoring the correlation among different assets. A possible way to solve the above problem is to provide a set of scenarios which include the future returns of several stocks, instead of a single one. The flow-based model is a kind of deep learning model proposed in recent years, which has powerful data generation abilities. In this paper, we use a flow-based conditional generative model to forecast the stock price scenario. We use real stock market data to verify the proposed method. The simulation results show that the model based on the proposed method can capture the complex dependence of the future stock relationship and provide more accurate and diversified forecasting results. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","flow-based model; scenario; stock price forecasting","Deep learning; Electronic trading; Financial markets; Data generation; Flow based; Flow-based models; Generative model; Learning models; Prediction-based; Scenario; Scenarios generation; Stock price forecasting; Stock price prediction; Forecasting","","","","Markowitz, Harry M., PORTFOLIO SELECTION, Journal of Finance, 7, 1, pp. 77-91, (1952); Management Science, (1991); Chiodi, Luca, Semi-absolute deviation rule for mutual funds portfolio selection, Annals of Operations Research, 124, 1-4, pp. 245-265, (2003); Tyrrel, Ralph Tyrrell Tyrrell, Conditional value-at-risk for general loss distributions, Journal of Banking and Finance, 26, 7, pp. 1443-1471, (2002); Zhang, Peter G., Time series forecasting using a hybrid ARIMA and neural network model, Neurocomputing, 50, pp. 159-175, (2003); Predicting the Direction of Stock Market Prices Using Random Forest, (2016); Barak, Sasan, Developing an approach to evaluate stocks by forecasting effective features with data mining methods, Expert Systems with Applications, 42, 3, pp. 1325-1339, (2015); Chen, Kai, A LSTM-based method for stock returns prediction: A case study of China stock market, pp. 2823-2824, (2015); Billah, Mustain, Stock market prediction using an improved training algorithm of neural network, (2017); Rimeh, El Fayedh, Scenario generation for multi-objective stochastic portfolio selection, (2013)","","Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Inc.","","18th IEEE International Conference on Networking, Sensing and Control, ICNSC 2021","","Xiamen","177193","","9781665440486","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85126719917"

The investigation is performed on intraday data with specific lag-times between published article headlines and realised stock prices. FinBERT, a natural language processing model which is fine-tuned specifically for financial news is used to perform sentiment analysis on the company related news headlines. Two base models, one with only historical stock price data as inputs and the other with both historical stock price data and sentiment data from the original BERT model is tested. An alternative model with have both historical stock price data and sentiment data from the fine tuned FinBERT model as additional features. A comparison is performed on both the base and alternative models using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE) as performance metrics. The results suggest that the use of news headline sentiment features from FinBERT significantly improve the predictive performance of LSTM networks in intraday stock price prediction.

Through the Bayesian models, we can consolidate the information of all analysts' recommendations on stocks and predict the post-recommendation price drifts of the underlying stocks. In addition, typically there are only a small number of recommendation revisions on specific stocks on each day. It implies that other analysts' views to a specific stock are unobservable. With the advantage of generative models, missing observations in the data of recommendation revisions can be accommodated easily. Secondly, we perform an empirical investigation of the Hong Kong equity market and find that the impact of recommendation revisions on stock prices is significant in the 1-day horizon, but insignificant in the longer time horizon when taking account of the transaction costs. Also, we propose trading strategies derived from the posterior probability of directions of price drifts based on the Bayesian models. In our experiment, during the out-of-sample period (1 Jan, 2019 to 21 Feb, 2020), the trading strategies gain double-digit profit returns after transaction costs. © 2025 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","analyst recommendations; Bayesian; machine learning; trading strategy","Bayesian networks; Commerce; Costs; Financial markets; Analyst recommendation; Bayesian; Bayesian modelling; Machine-learning; Market impacts; Probabilistic analysis; Probabilistic framework; Stock price movements; Trading strategies; Transaction cost; Machine learning","","","","Jegadeesh, Narasimhan, Do analysts?

Many attempts have been reported to ascertain how news influences stock prices. Stock price fluctuations of highly influential companies can have a major impact on the economy as a whole. In particular, the automobile industry is a colossal industry that leads the Japanese industry. However, the limitations in the number of available data sets usually become the hurdle for the model accuracy. In this study, we constructed a news evaluation model utilizing GPT-2. A news evaluation model is a model that evaluates news articles distributed to financial markets based on price fluctuation rates and predicts fluctuations in stock prices. We have added news articles generated by GPT-2 as data for analysis. Besides, we used a co-occurrence network analysis to review the overview of the news articles. News articles were classified through Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). The results showed that the accuracy of the news evaluation model improved by generating news articles using a language generation model through GPT-2. More detailed analyses are planned for the future. © 2020 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Co-occurrence network; Deep learning; Financial markets; GPT-2; Language generation; LSTM","Commerce; Costs; Financial markets; Co-occurrence networks; Evaluation modeling; Japanese industry; Language generation; Model accuracy; News articles; Price fluctuation; Stock price fluctuation; Long short-term memory","","","","Proceedings of the International Conference on Computer Vision, (2015); Journal of Portfolio Management, (1989); Building Natural Language Generation Systems, (2000); Fung, Gabriel Pui Cheong, News sensitive stock trend prediction, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2336, pp. 481-493, (2002); Fung, Pui Cheong Gabriel, Stock prediction: Integrating text mining approach using real-time news, 2003-January, pp. 395-402, (2003); Fruchterman, Thomas M.J., Graph drawing by force‐directed placement, Software - Practice and Experience, 21, 11, pp. 1129-1164, (1991); Using News Articles to Predict Stock Price Movements, (2020); Hochreiter, Sepp, Long Short-Term Memory, Neural Computation, 9, 8, pp. 1735-1780, (1997); Automobile Industry Strategy, (2014); Mittermayer, Marc André, Forecasting intraday stock price trends with text mining techniques, Proceedings of the Hawaii International Conference on System Science, 37, pp. 1029-1038, (2004)","Sakamoto, M.; Okazaki, N.; Mineshima, K.; Satoh, K.","Springer Science and Business Media Deutschland GmbH info@springer-sbm.com","","11th JSAI International Symposium on Artificial Intelligence, JSAI-isAI 2019","","Yokohama","245369","16113349; 03029743","9783032042064; 9783032050076; 9783032008909; 9783031952951; 9783032050014; 9783031977718; 9783032048479; 9783032006462; 9783031966248; 9783032007995","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-85091506291"

Approaches involving conventional technical analysis have been investigated to identify certain patterns in past price movements, which in turn helps to predict future price movements. However, the financial market is highly sensitive to specific events, including corporate buyouts, product releases, and the like. Therefore, recent research has focused on modeling relationships between these events that appear in the news articles and future price movements; however, a very large number of news articles are published daily, each article containing rich information, which results in overfitting to past price movements used for parameter adjustment. Given the above, we propose a model based on a generative model of news articles that includes price movement as a condition, thereby avoiding excessive overfitting thanks to the nature of the generative model. We evaluate our proposed model using historical price movements of Nikkei 225 and Standard & Poor's 500 Stock Index, confirming that our model predicts future price movements better than such conventional classifiers as support vector machines and multilayer perceptrons. Further, our proposed model extracts significant words from news articles that are directly related to future stock price movements. © 2018 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Deep learning; Generative model; News articles; Stock price prediction","Costs; Deep learning; Forecasting; Conventional classifier; Generative model; Model relationships; News articles; Parameter adjustments; Stock price movements; Stock price prediction; Technical analysis; Financial markets","","","This study was partially supported by the JSPS KAKENHI (16K12487), Kayamori Foundation of Information Science Advancement, and SEI Group CSR Foundation.","Black, Fischer, The pricing of options and corporate liabilities, Journal of Political Economy, 81, 3, pp. 637-657, (1973); Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, (1999); Tay, Eng Hock Francis, Application of support vector machines in financial time series forecasting, Omega (United Kingdom), 29, 4, pp. 309-317, (2001); Kim, Kyoung-jae, Financial time series forecasting using support vector machines, Neurocomputing, 55, 1-2, pp. 307-319, (2003); Hassan, Rafiul Rafiul, A fusion model of HMM, ANN and GA for stock market forecasting, Expert Systems with Applications, 33, 1, pp. 171-180, (2007); Cavalcante, Rodolfo C., Computational Intelligence and Financial Markets: A Survey and Future Directions, Expert Systems with Applications, 55, pp. 194-211, (2016); Journal of Business, (1965); Kdd 2000 Workshop on Text Mining, (2000); Amcis 2006 Proceedings, (2006); Luss, Ronny, Predicting abnormal returns from news using text classification, Quantitative Finance, 15, 6, pp. 999-1012, (2015)","","Institute of Electronics, Information and Communication, Engineers, IEICE export@maruzen.co.jp","","","","","","09168532; 17451361","","ITISE","","English","Article","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-85044768987"

In this paper, we propose to study this important but less explored problem. Our key intuition is that searches are triggered by different pre-search contexts, but the triggering relations are often hidden. For example, a user may search ""bitcoin"" because of a news article or an email the user just read, but the system does not know which of the pre-search contexts (the news article or the email) is the triggering source. Following this intuition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of pre-search context on a large-scale user log, which not only verifies the hidden triggering relations in the real world but also identifies a set of important characteristics of pre-search context and their triggered queries. Since the hidden triggering relations make it challenging to directly use pre-search context for intent prediction, we develop a mixture generative model to learn without any supervision how queries are triggered by different types of pre-search context. Further, we discuss how to apply our model to improve query prediction and query auto-completion. Our experiments on a large-scale of real-world data show that our model could accurately predict user search intent with pre-search context and improve upon the state-of-the-art methods significantly. © 2016 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","Pre-search context; Query auto-completion; Query prediction; Search context; Search intent","Electronic mail; Information retrieval; Auto completion; Generative model; In-depth analysis; News articles; Search contexts; Search intents; State-of-the-art methods; Triggering source; Forecasting","","","","Www 11; Bennett, Paul N., Modeling the impact of short- and long-term behavior on search personalization, pp. 185-194, (2012); Bordino, Ilaria, From Machu-Picchu to ""rafting the urubamba river"": Anticipating information needs via the entity-query graph, pp. 275-284, (2013); Cao, Huanhuan, Context-aware query classification, pp. 3-10, (2009); Cao, Huanhuan, Towards context-aware search by learning a very large variable length Hidden Markov Model from search logs, pp. 191-200, (2009); Cao, Huanhuan, Context-aware query suggestion by mining click-through and session data, Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining, pp. 875-883, (2008); Www 10; Craswell, Nick, Random walks on the click graph, pp. 239-246, (2007); Search Engines Information Retrieval in Practice, (2009); SIGIR 04, (2020)","","Association for Computing Machinery, Inc acmhelp@acm.org","ACM Special Interest Group on Information Retrieval (SIGIR)","38th International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval, SIGIR 2015","","Santiago","117001","","9781450336215","","","English","Conference paper","Final","","Scopus","2-s2.0-84953791992"

One of the key issues is to identify long-term changes accurately in time-varying data. Bayesian Online Change Point Detection (BO-CPD) algorithms efficiently detect long-term changes without assuming the Markov property which is vulnerable to local signal noise. We propose a Document based BO-CPD (DBO-CPD) model which automatically detects long-term temporal changes of continuous variables based on a novel dynamic Bayesian analysis which combines a non-parametric regression, the Gaussian Process (GP), with generative models of texts such as news articles and posts on social networks. Since texts often include important clues of signal changes, DBO-CPD enables the accurate prediction of long-term changes accurately. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing BO-CPDs in two real-world datasets: stock prices and movie revenues. © 2022 Elsevier B.V., All rights reserved.","","Bayesian networks; Electronic trading; Accurate prediction; Bayesian Analysis; Bayesian on-line change point detections; Continuous variables; Non-parametric regression; Non-stationary time series; Real-world datasets; Time-varying data; Natural language processing systems","","","","Bayesian Online Changepoint Detection, (2007); Annals of Statistics, (1992); Journal of the American Statistical Association, (1993); Bollen, Johan, Twitter mood predicts the stock market, Journal of Computational Science, 2, 1, pp. 1-8, (2011); Chen, Jie, Testing and Locating Variance Changepoints with Application to Stock Prices, Journal of the American Statistical Association, 92, 438, pp. 739-747, (1997); Chib, Siddhartha, Estimation and comparison of multiple change-point models, Journal of Econometrics, 86, 2, pp. 221-241, (1998); Chu, Pao Shin, Bayesian change-point analysis of tropical cyclone activity: The central North Pacific case, Journal of Climate, 17, 24, pp. 4893-4901, (2004); Statistical Distributions, (2011); Fung, Gabriel Pui Cheong, News sensitive stock trend prediction, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, 2336, pp. 481-493, (2002); Fung, Pui Cheong Gabriel, Stock prediction: Integrating text mining approach using real-time news, 2003-January, pp. 395-402, (2003)","","Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL)","Baidu; Bloomberg; et al.; facebook; Google; Linkedin","Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing, EMNLP 2015","","Lisbon","116677","","9781941643327","","","English","Conference paper","Final","All Open Access; Gold Open Access","Scopus","2-s2.0-84959884669"

Dense urban environments provide a complex settlement, where solar availability and urban daylight can become a scarce commodity, especially since buildings become increasingly taller. This is mainly due to the complex and dynamic overshadowing effects created on the building envelope. Accurately quantifying these effects could be the key to predicting reductions in solar availability which, in turn, can significantly affect daylight and the thermal performance of buildings, as well as the potential for PVs and other renewables sources. It is therefore necessary to use simulation tools in order to predict the mutual complex effects.

Kernel methods are used to estimate densities for the distribution of positive and negative returns, and these distributions are then combined toproduce probability estimates for return forecasts. An advantage of the technique is that it involves very few parameters compared to regression-based approaches, the only free parameters being those that control the shape of the windowing kernel. A special form is proposed for the kernel covariance matrix. This allows recent data more influence than less recent data in determining the densities, and is important in preventing overfitting.

Findings - E&Y client firms' mean and median abnormal stock returns are significantly positive for two events, the approval of the sale by E&Y's partners, and the approval of the transaction by Cap Gemini stockholders. Research limitations/implications - This study is limitedto one major audit firm for reasons discussed in the paper.
